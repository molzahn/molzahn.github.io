<h1><font size="5">Biography</font></h1>

			<p>I grew up in Green Bay, WI and attended Preble High School, obtaining my diploma in 2004. I earned the Bachelor's of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics, graduating in 2008 with highest distinction honors. During my undergraduate program, I interned at Wisconsin Public Service Corporation in Green Bay, working three summers in information technology and one summer in electric distribution engineering. I also interned at Ford Motor Company before the start of graduate school, where I developed computer models of electric motors used in hybrid vehicles. </p>

<p>My graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison consisted of courses and research in both engineering and policy. I completed the graduate certificate in <a href="http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/graduate_certificates/eap/">Energy Analysis and Policy</a> (EAP) in May 2010. Working with Madison Gas and Electric, the capstone project for the EAP certificate program investigated locations for electric vehicle charging stations. 

<p>I completed the Master's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in December 2010. My master's research focused on formulation of the power flow equations as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem and on a new way to solve the induction machine initial conditions problem for dynamic power system simulations (<a href="pubs/molzahn-msthesis.pdf">thesis pdf</a>). </p>

<p>In December 2012, I completed the Master's of Public Affairs degree in the La Follette School of Public Affairs at UW-Madison. This program primarily focused on coursework in such topics as economics, policy analysis, public management, and statistics. I also had the opportunity to work with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to publish a paper (<a href="pubs/molzahn_singletary-speculation.pdf">pdf</a>) on a statistical investigation of speculation in a specific type of electricity market (the financial transmission rights market of the Midwest Independent System Operator).</p>

<p>During my graduate program, I also worked with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to develop methodologies for ranking the importance of transmission facilities for several purposes: determining which transmission facilities are part of the "bulk electric system" and therefore under FERC's jurisdiction (<a href="pubs/schwarting_molzahn_demarco_lesieutre-hicss2011.pdf">pdf</a>), identifying which facilities are most important to transmission system reliability, and finding transmission facilities that are most important for reliability with respect to a specified important location such as a military base. I conducted a three-day training session at FERC in June 2013.</p>

<p>In Fall 2012, I had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for ECE 427: Electric Power Systems. I led a weekly discussion section, held biweekly office hours, answered student questions, and created homework solutions. Helping students with the final project regarding transmission expansion planning was particularly rewarding.</p>

<p>I completed the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering in August of 2013. My dissertation is titled "<a href="pubs/molzahn-dissertation.pdf">Application of Semidefinite Optimizaton Techniques to Problems in Electric Power Systems</a>." Semidefinite programming is a type of conic optimization that is capable of finding the global optimum for many engineering problems. I use semidefinite programming to investigate the power flow and optimal power flow problems, which are important for electric power system reliability and economics (see, e.g., <a href="pubs/lesieutre_molzahn_borden_demarco-allerton2011.pdf">pdf1</a>, <a href="pubs/molzahn_lesieutre_demarco-pfcondition.pdf">pdf2</a>, <a href="pubs/molzahn_holzer_lesieutre_demarco-large_scale_sdp_opf.pdf">pdf3</a>). My dissertation received second place for the 2014 Harold A. Peterson Best Dissertation Award in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>

<p>I am very thankful to my colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, particularly my advisor <a href="http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/lesieutre_bernard.html">Dr. Bernard Lesieutre</a> and the other members of my committee, <a href="http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/demarco_christopher.html">Dr. Christopher DeMarco</a>, <a href="http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/jahns_thomas.html">Dr. Thomas Jahns</a>, <a href="http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/venkataramanan_giri.html">Dr. Giri Venkataramanan</a>, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris">Dr. Michael Ferris</a>, and <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/">Dr. Steven Wright</a>. I would also like to thank the professors in the La Follette School of Public Affairs, especially <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/directory/faculty/carolyn-heinrich">Dr. Carolyn Heinrich</a> and <a href="http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/facultystaff/nemet-gregory.html">Dr. Gregory Nemet</a>.</p>

<p>I appreciate the financial support of the UW-Madison Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Distinguished Fellowship, the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Grainger Power Engineering Scholarship, and research and teaching assistanceships.</p>

<p>From September 2013 to August 2015, I was a <a href="http://sustainability.umich.edu/dow/postdoctoral">Dow Sustainability Fellow</a> working with <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~hiskens/">Dr. Ian Hiskens</a> at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I was also fortunate to have opportunities to work with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jlmath/">Dr. Johanna Mathieu</a>, <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/">Dr. Laura Balzano</a>, <a href="http://www.eeh.ee.ethz.ch/en/power/power-systems-laboratory/people/alumni/uid/4965.html">Dr. Maria Vrakopoulou</a>, and <a href="https://www.valpo.edu/college-of-engineering/faculty/">Dr. Jenny Felder Marley</a> as well as many other great researchers. In this position, I continued my work in applying optimization techniques and policy analysis to problems in the field of electric power systems.</p>

<p>In August 2015, I began a staff position as a computational engineer at Argonne National Laboratory in the Energy Systems Division, where I am continuing work in optimization and control of electric power systems as well as new work related to cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy waterskiing, hiking, camping, and traveling. I am also interested in photography. (I own a Nikon D3100 and Tamron 18-300 mm lens, which is a bit dated now but still works well.) As  a shareholder of the world's greatest sporting franchise, I need to keep an eye on my investment and therefore watch and attend football games of the 13-time-champion Green Bay Packers football team. I am also a fan of the Badger hockey, football, and basketball teams.</p>
