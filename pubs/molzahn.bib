	abstract={In the field of power system engineering, the optimal power flow problem is essential in planning and operations. With increasing system size and complexity, the computational requirements needed to solve practical optimal power flow problems continues to grow. Increasing computational requirements make the possibility of performing these computations remotely with cloud computing appealing. However, power system structure and component values are often confidential; therefore, the problem cannot be shared. To address this issue of confidential information in cloud computing, some techniques for masking optimization problems have been developed. The work of this paper builds upon these techniques for optimization problems but is specifically developed for addressing the DC and AC optimal power flow problems. We study the application of masking a sample OPF using the IEEE 14-bus network.},

	abstract={In this paper we present a method to transform optimal power flow models to enable the sharing of equivalent data sets while preserving privacy of an original data set. Importantly, the generated models preserve a power system structure with certain characteristics chosen by the developer. The needed transformations are presented on the DC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model.},

	abstract={The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be located by solving a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. Typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions, corresponding to equilibria of the model, are of physical interest. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to locate only all equilibria of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. We compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.},
