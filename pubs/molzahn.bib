	abstract={The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be located by solving a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. Typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions, corresponding to equilibria of the model, are of physical interest. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to locate only all equilibria of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. We compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.},

	abstract={The potential for cyberattacks is an emerging challenge to maintaining reliable and economic operation of electric power systems. Possible cyberattacks include intrusions to the parameter data at a control center. In this class of attacks, algorithms at the control center are correctly executed, but the attacker's modification of the associated parameter data yields improper results. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and characterizing cyberattacks to the network parameter data, with specific application to optimal power flow problems. The proposed algorithm evaluates whether historical operating point data are consistent with the network parameters. Inconsistencies indicating potential cyberattacks are characterized using historical operational data (power injections and voltage phasors) along with network parameter data. Simulated test cases illustrate the  proposed algorithm's detection and characterization capabilities.},

The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space.

Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, "bound tightening" and "grid pruning" algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem.

	abstract={Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation's solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of 8 time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time and solution quality.},

For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.},

	abstract={Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. This paper uses the example problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization and a related "mixed semidefinite/second-order cone programming" hierarchy.},

While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in "tighter" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.},

This study details a statistical model for characterizing market participants in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) FTR auctions as either speculators or physical participants. Estimates of the total profit made by speculators and measures of the liquidity provided by speculators in FTR auctions are then determined. A sensitivity analysis is used to provide reasonable bounds for these estimates. The best estimates determined in this analysis show speculator profits of 152% of total market profits, equal to $283 million over three years, with speculator transactions accounting for 74% of total market transactions on a megawatt basis.},

		abstract={Many power system optimization problems are inherently affected by uncertainty, as it is generally impossible to exactly forecast load or renewable generation. Finding solutions that lead to low-cost, yet secure operation for a range of conditions is an important concern to system operators. This paper considers an iterative algorithm for solving power system optimization problems that include models of uncertainty and AC power flow physics. This algorithm iterates between solving deterministic nonlinear optimization problems with the AC power flow model and updating constraint tightenings that adjust the constraints to facilitate secure operation. Decoupling the uncertainty and the nonlinear optimization steps provides several advantages, such as tractability for large-scale problems and the ability to separately apply state-of-the-art techniques for handling the uncertainty and the nonlinearity. Using numerical examples and theoretical analyses, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of the iterative algorithm in solving general power system optimization problems. This paper further characterizes the behavior of the iterative algorithm with respect to convergence, optimality, and infeasibility, and suggests several modifications to improve performance.},

		abstract={Electric power systems with high penetrations of fluctuating renewable generation may operate close to their stability limits. Demand response can be used to improve power system stability. For example, it is already used to provide frequency control, improving frequency stability. This paper presents a new demand response strategy that uses fast-acting flexible loads to change the loading pattern while keeping the total load constant, improving steady-state voltage stability without affecting the system frequency. The new loading pattern is maintained only for a short period of time until the generators can be re-dispatched. Our goal is to find a permissible loading pattern that maximizes the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, which serves as a measure of voltage stability. The corresponding non-convex optimization problem is solved with an iterative linear programming approach that uses eigenvalue sensitivities and a linearization of the AC power flow equations. Using two IEEE test cases as illustrative examples, we show that the loading patterns resulting from the proposed approach give smallest singular values that are very close to those obtained from a brute force search. The results are also compared to another voltage stability measure given by the maximum loading margin for uniformly varying power injections.},

	abstract={Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under "normal" operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are "small". However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks.

While Newton-based methods typically find the "high-voltage" solution to the power flow equations, which is of primary interest, there are potentially many "low-voltage" solutions that are useful for certain analyses. This paper addresses the number of solutions to the power flow equations. There exist upper bounds on the number of power flow solutions; however, there is only limited work regarding bounds that are functions of network topology. This paper empirically explores the relationship between the network topology, as characterized by the maximal cliques, and the number of power flow solutions. To facilitate this analysis, we use a numerical polynomial homotopy continuation approach that is guaranteed to find all complex solutions to the power flow equations. The number of solutions obtained from this approach upper bounds the number of real solutions. Testing with many small networks informs the development of upper bounds that are functions of the network topology. Initial results include empirically derived expressions for the maximum number of solutions for certain classes of network topologies.},

		abstract={The power flow equations are at the core of most of the computations for designing and operating electric grids. This system of multivariate nonlinear equations relate the power injections and voltages in an electric power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to solve these equations, from Newton-based methods to homotopy continuation and other optimization-based methods. Although many of these methods often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution, challenges remain for finding low-voltage solutions, which play significant roles in certain stability-related computations. While we do not claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods, this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in power flow solution methods to the wider power systems community as well as bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization communities to power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the traditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we focus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, Gro\"{o}bner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using semidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an upper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review the current status of research in this direction.},

By preprocessing the network model to eliminate low-impedance lines, this paper demonstrates the capability of the moment relaxations to globally solve large OPF problems that minimize active power losses for portions of several European power systems. Large problems with more general objective functions have thus far been computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment relaxations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the combination of an objective function penalization with the moment relaxations. This combination yields feasible points with objective function values that are close to the global optimum of several large OPF problems.

The challenge of populating such component models is particularly apparent in optimal power flow applications, in which incorrect parameters and/or constraint limits can yield overall system representations with either unrealistically large feasible regions or an empty feasible set. Unfortunately, many data sets, particularly those of publicly available test cases, were originally developed to illustrate simpler "power flow only" applications, and may contain unrealistic values or wholly omit important constraint limits. This paper describes engineering-based approaches to obtain credible estimates for parameters and limits associated with line-flow constraints and generator capability curves, as may be employed in a number of steady state analyses such as the optimal power flow. These can substitute for missing or unrealistic data in test systems for which more fully detailed, "real-world" component specifications and limits are not available, and thereby make such test systems more valuable as research tools.},

Conditions for the success or failure of the semidefinite relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the semidefinite relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The semidefinite relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the semidefinite relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics.},

		abstract={Motivated by the potential for improvements in electric power system economics and reliability, this dissertation investigates applications of a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations, which model the steady-state relationship between power injections and voltages in a power system. In contrast to other optimal power flow solution techniques, semidefinite program solvers can reliably find a global optimum in polynomial time when the semidefinite relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero relaxation gap). Semidefinite relaxations have been applied to a variety of computationally difficult problems in many fields. The power systems literature details limited success in applying semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which minimizes operating cost under engineering and network constraints. Semidefinite programming holds significant promise for application to other power systems problems. This dissertation first investigates power system economics using a semidefinite relaxation of the OPF problem. In contrast to claims in the literature, this dissertation shows that the semidefinite relaxation may fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., the solution has non-zero relaxation gap) for some practical problems. This dissertation also provides computational and modeling advances required for solving large-scale, realistic OPF problems. Modeling advances include allowing multiple generators at the same bus; parallel transmission lines and transformers; and an approximate method for modeling constant impedance, constant current, constant power (ZIP) loads. Existing methods exploit system sparsity to speed computation using matrix completion techniques that decompose the large positive semidefinite matrix constraint into constraints on many smaller matrices. Computational advances include modifying the matrix decomposition techniques for further reductions in solver times, extending the applicability of an existing decomposition, and a method for obtaining an optimal voltage profile from a solution to a decomposed semidefinite program. This dissertation also provides a sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution obtained by any method. This dissertation next provides techniques for improving power system reliability. The first reliability-related research develops a sufficient condition under which the power flow equations have no solution. This sufficient condition is evaluated using a feasible semidefinite optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solvability boundary. This distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins. A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); this dissertation additionally introduces a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages. This dissertation considers generators modeled as ideal voltage sources and generators with reactive power limits, which require either mixed-integer semidefinite programming or sum of squares programming formulations. Also related to power system reliability is the problem of finding multiple solutions to the power flow equations. Power systems typically operate at a high-voltage, stable power flow solution; however, other solutions are used for stability calculations. Existing literature claims that a continuation-based algorithm can reliably find all power flow solutions. This claim is demonstrated to be incorrect with a small counterexample system. Thus, no computationally tractable algorithms exist for reliably finding all power flow solutions. Methods for calculating multiple power flow solutions therefore deserve further research. This dissertation describes a method for finding multiple power flow solutions using semidefinite programming. Results suggest the method's promise for identifying large numbers of power flow solutions. Although the semidefinite relaxation of the power flow equations is often "tight," non-zero relaxation gap solutions can occur. This dissertation investigates examples of non-zero relaxation gap solutions to semidefinite formulations for the optimal power flow problem, for the power flow insolvability condition, and for determining multiple solutions to the power flow equations.},

		abstract={Eigenvalue problems incorporate multiplicative nonlinearities in otherwise linear equations. Two power systems problems with multiplicative nonlinearities are reformulated as eigenvalue problems. Reformulation allows for the application of eigenvalue theory and solution techniques to these problems. The first problem involves determination of the initial conditions for induction machine internal variables in a non-linear dynamic power system analysis. The internal variables of stator and rotor currents, rotor speed, and mechanical torque must be determined from the given values of input real power, stator voltage magnitude, and stator voltage angle. This problem is posed in an eigenvalue formulation that can be solved using standard linear algebra techniques. The eigenvalue formulation allows for determination of all possible solutions for the internal variables rather than the single solution obtained from traditional iterative methods. Additionally, the absence of non-zero real eigenvalues indicates that the problem has no solution. Both single-cage and double-cage induction machine models are considered, and numeric examples are presented. The second problem involves reformulation of the power flow equations as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem. In this formulation, both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are composed of the $d$ and $q$ orthogonal components of the bus voltages. The two parameter formulation of the power flow equations for two bus systems can be solved directly by decomposing the problem into two generalized eigenvalue problems that must be simultaneously satisfied. Since $n$ bus systems require $2\left(n-1\right)$ parameter eigenvalue problems, which do not yet have a general solution method for $n > 2$, systems with more than two buses are not yet directly solvable from the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation. In addition to direct solution, two other research avenues for the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations are pursued. First, motivated by eigenvalue problem structure, a reformulation of the multiparameter eigenvalue form of the power flow equations is presented. Although it is without known practical applications, this reformulation and the intermediate results in its derivation are interesting from a theoretical standpoint. Second, an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is performed on the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations. The linearization obtained from the eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is equivalent to the linearization obtained from the power flow Jacobian. Future developments in multiparameter eigenvalue theory may provide additional insights into solutions of the power flow equations. General solution techniques for multiparameter eigenvalue problems with more than two parameters may enable direct solution of the power flow equations. A method for determining the number of solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful as a stopping condition for continuation power flows. Conditions for the existence of any solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful for finding the point of voltage collapse and for analyzing power systems in heavily loaded conditions.},
