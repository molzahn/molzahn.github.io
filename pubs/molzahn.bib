	abstract={The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be located by solving a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. Typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions, corresponding to equilibria of the model, are of physical interest. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to locate only all equilibria of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. We compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.},

	abstract={The potential for cyberattacks is an emerging challenge to maintaining reliable and economic operation of electric power systems. Possible cyberattacks include intrusions to the parameter data at a control center. In this class of attacks, algorithms at the control center are correctly executed, but the attacker's modification of the associated parameter data yields improper results. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and characterizing cyberattacks to the network parameter data, with specific application to optimal power flow problems. The proposed algorithm evaluates whether historical operating point data are consistent with the network parameters. Inconsistencies indicating potential cyberattacks are characterized using historical operational data (power injections and voltage phasors) along with network parameter data. Simulated test cases illustrate the  proposed algorithm's detection and characterization capabilities.},

	abstract={The solution to an optimal power flow (OPF) problem provides a minimum cost operating point for an electric power system. The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm that is guaranteed to compute the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, ``bound tightening'' and ``grid pruning'' algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem. The proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.},

	abstract={Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation’s solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of 8 time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time and solution quality.},

For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.},

	abstract={Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. This paper uses the example problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization and a related “mixed semidefinite/second-order cone programming” hierarchy.},

While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in “tighter” relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.},

While speculators likely increase the liquidity of FTR auction markets, physical participants and ultimately ratepayers bear the cost of the profits made by speculators. Given the regulated nature of physical participants in contrast to the largely unregulated speculators, it is hypothesized that speculators in FTR auction markets are obtaining substantial profits at the expense of physical participants. This study details a statistical model for characterizing market participants in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) FTR auctions as either speculators or physical participants. Estimates of the total profit made by speculators and measures of the liquidity provided by speculators in FTR auctions are then determined. A sensitivity analysis is used to provide reasonable bounds for these estimates. The best estimates determined in this analysis show speculator profits of 152% of total market profits, equal to $283 million over three years, with speculator transactions accounting for 74% of total market transactions on a megawatt basis.},

With increasing system size and complexity, the computational requirements needed to solve practical optimal power flow problems continues to grow. Increasing computational requirements make the possibility of performing these computations remotely with cloud computing appealing. However, power system structure and component values are often confidential; therefore, the problem cannot be shared. To address this issue of confidential information in cloud computing, some techniques for masking optimization problems have been developed. The work of this paper builds upon these techniques for optimization problems but is specifically developed for addressing the DC and AC optimal power flow problems.
