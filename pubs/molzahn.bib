	abstract={The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be located by solving a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. Typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions, corresponding to equilibria of the model, are of physical interest. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to locate only all equilibria of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. We compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.},

	title={{Detection and Characterization of Intrusions to Network Parameter Data in Electric Power Systems}},
	year={},
	keywords={Cybersecurity, Optimal Power Flow},
	abstract={The potential for cyberattacks is an emerging challenge to maintaining reliable and economic operation of electric power systems. Possible cyberattacks include intrusions to the parameter data at a control center. In this class of attacks, algorithms at the control center are correctly executed, but the attacker's modification of the associated parameter data yields improper results. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and characterizing cyberattacks to the network parameter data, with specific application to optimal power flow problems. The proposed algorithm evaluates whether historical operating point data are consistent with the network parameters. Inconsistencies indicating potential cyberattacks are characterized using historical operational data (power injections and voltage phasors) along with network parameter data. Simulated test cases illustrate the  proposed algorithm's detection and characterization capabilities.},

	abstract={We consider the problem of finding the global optimum of a real-valued complex polynomial on a compact set defined by real-valued complex polynomial inequalities. It reduces to solving a sequence of complex semidefinite programming relaxations that grow tighter and tighter thanks to D'Angelo's and Putinar's Positivstellenstatz discovered in 2008. In other words, the Lasserre hierarchy may be transposed to complex numbers. We propose an algorithm for exploiting sparsity and apply the complex hierarchy to problems with several thousand complex variables. They consist in computing optimal power flows in the European high-voltage transmission network.},

An elliptical representation of the sphere-confined Fritz John conditions is constructed from a quadratic formulation of the ACOPF problem. Application of a branch tracing method to the elliptical formulation enables the calculation of multiple solutions. Further, a monotone search strategy enhances the computational efficiency of finding multiple local solutions with improved objective values. The proposed approach is first illustrated using two small examples with known feasible spaces. Then, four additional local solutions to a 39-bus system are found using the proposed approach.},

	abstract={The solution to an optimal power flow (OPF) problem provides a minimum cost operating point for an electric power system. The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm that is guaranteed to compute the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, ``bound tightening'' and ``grid pruning'' algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem. The proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.},

	keywords={Optimal Power Flow},
	abstract={Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation’s solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of 8 time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time and solution quality.},

	abstract={A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.},

	abstract={In the field of power system engineering, the optimal power flow problem is essential in planning and operations. With increasing system size and complexity, the computational requirements needed to solve practical optimal power flow problems continues to grow. Increasing computational requirements make the possibility of performing these computations remotely with cloud computing appealing. However, power system structure and component values are often confidential; therefore, the problem cannot be shared. To address this issue of confidential information in cloud computing, some techniques for masking optimization problems have been developed. The work of this paper builds upon these techniques for optimization problems but is specifically developed for addressing the DC and AC optimal power flow problems. We study the application of masking a sample OPF using the IEEE 14-bus network.},
