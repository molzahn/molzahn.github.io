			<p>I am a computational engineer at Argonne National Laboratory working on electric power systems. I completed the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in August 2013 and the Dow postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan in August 2015. My research interests focus on developing optimization and control algorithms to improve the reliability and economics of electric power systems.</p></td><td style="width:12%;"></td></tr></table>

			<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>My research develops new optimization and control algorithms for electric power systems. Examples of specific research topics in this area include the use of optimization techniques, such as semidefinite programming, to solve the optimal power flow problem and to create voltage stability margins; designing methodologies for determining the most important transmission facilities for system reliability; and developing algorithms for detecting and mitigating cyberattacks.</p>

			<h1>Teaching Background</h1>

<p>My teaching has been informed by both theoretical and practical experience. Theoretical experience includes courses on teaching science and engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Michigan. I also obtained practical experience with a teaching assistanceship for an advanced-level course in electric power systems. Further experience in my current professional capacity includes serving as a guest lecturer, a co-leader of research group meetings, and a co-advisor of several graduate students. Drawing on these experiences, my teaching philosophy is best summarized through three main objectives: (1) impart a sound foundation of basic knowledge for all students using an active lecture style, (2) provide broad context in order to make connections among course materials, and (3) encourage student engagement through authentic, practical, and meaningful teaching.</p>
