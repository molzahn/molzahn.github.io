			<p>I am an associate professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology working on electric power systems. I also hold an affiliate appointment as a computational engineer in the Energy Systems Division at Argonne National Laboratory, where I was a research staff member from 2015 through 2018. I completed the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2013 and the Dow postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan in 2015. My research interests focus on developing optimization and control algorithms to improve the reliability, resiliency, equity, and efficiency of electric power systems.</p></td><td style="width:12%;"></td></tr></table>

			<h1>Teaching Background</h1>

<p>My teaching has been informed by both theoretical and practical experience. Theoretical experience includes courses on teaching science and engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Michigan. I also obtained practical experience with a teaching assistanceship for an advanced-level course in electric power systems. Further experience in my current professional capacity includes serving as a guest lecturer, a co-leader of research group meetings, and a co-advisor of several graduate students. Drawing on these experiences, my teaching philosophy is best summarized through three main objectives: (1) impart a sound foundation of basic knowledge for all students using an active lecture style, (2) provide broad context in order to make connections among course materials, and (3) encourage student engagement through authentic, practical, and meaningful teaching.</p>
