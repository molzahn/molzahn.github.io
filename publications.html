				<span id="kuramoto2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, n, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of n. For these, the equilibria can be located by solving a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. Typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions, corresponding to equilibria of the model, are of physical interest. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to locate only all equilibria of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system.  We compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.

				<span id="cyber2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The potential for cyberattacks is an emerging challenge to maintaining reliable and economic operation of electric power systems. Possible cyberattacks include intrusions to the parameter data at a control center. In this class of attacks, algorithms at the control center are correctly executed, but the attacker's modification of the associated parameter data yields improper results. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and characterizing cyberattacks to the network parameter data, with specific application to optimal power flow problems. The proposed algorithm evaluates whether historical operating point data are consistent with the network parameters. Inconsistencies indicating potential cyberattacks are characterized using historical operational data (power injections and voltage phasors) along with network parameter data. Simulated test cases illustrate the  proposed algorithm's detection and characterization capabilities.

				<span id="large_scale_polyopt2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					We propose general notions to deal with large scale polynomial optimization problems and demonstrate their efficiency on a key industrial problem of the twenty first century, namely the optimal power flow problem. These notions enable us to find global minimizers on instances with up to 4,500 variables and 14,500 constraints. First, we generalize the Lasserre hierarchy from real to complex to numbers in order to enhance its tractability when dealing with complex polynomial optimization. Complex numbers are typically used to represent oscillatory phenomena, which are omnipresent in physical systems. Using the notion of hyponormality in operator theory, we provide a finite convergence criterion which generalizes the Curto-Fialkow conditions of the real Lasserre hierarchy. Second, we introduce the multi-ordered Lasserre hierarchy in order to exploit sparsity in polynomial optimization problems (in real or complex variables) while preserving global convergence. It is based on two ideas: 1) to use a different relaxation order for each constraint, and 2) to iteratively seek a closest measure to the truncated moment data until a measure matches the truncated data. Third and last, we exhibit a block diagonal structure of the Lasserre hierarchy in the presence of commonly encountered symmetries.

				<span id="nonconvexity_search2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Optimal power flow (OPF) is an important problem in the operation of electric power systems. The solution to an OPF problem provides a minimum cost operating point that satisfies constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. Accordingly, developing better understandings of the non-convexities in OPF feasible spaces is relevant to improving solution algorithms and creating OPF test cases for benchmarking purposes. This paper proposes an algorithm that uses local solution techniques to identify and characterize non-convexities in OPF feasible spaces. This algorithm searches for a pair of feasible points such that there exists at least one infeasible point on the line segment connecting these points. Such a pair of points certifies the existence of a non-convexity in the OPF feasible space. Moreover, the constraint violations at the point along the connecting line segment characterize the physical explanation of the non-convexity. Numerical test cases include several small systems as illustrative examples as well as modified IEEE systems.

				<span id="acopf_robust2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					With growing penetrations of stochastic renewable generation and the need to accurately model the network physics, optimization problems that explicitly consider uncertainty and the AC power flow equations are becoming increasingly important to the operation of electric power systems. This paper proposes an AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) algorithm which yields an operating point that is guaranteed to be robust to all realizations of stochastic generation within a specified uncertainty set. The algorithm tightens the constraints in the original AC OPF problem in order to determine an operating point that accommodates fluctuations due to uncertain generation by iterating between two steps: 1) solving a deterministic AC OPF problem with tightened constraint limits, and 2) using convex relaxation techniques to obtain conservative bounds on updated constraint tightenings which ensure that any realization within the uncertainty set will not result in violation of the operational constraints. Additionally, satisfaction of a sufficient condition for power flow solvability related to the static transfer stability limits completes the algorithm's robust feasibility guarantee. The algorithm is demonstrated using a small illustrative example and applied to several IEEE test cases.

				<span id="adaptive_linearizations2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The power flow equations are at the heart of many optimization and control problems relevant to electric power systems. The nonlinearity of these equations leads to computational challenges, such as non-convexity. Accordingly, various linearization techniques are often used to approximate the power flow equations. In contrast to the wide variety of general linearization techniques in the power systems literature, this paper computes a linear approximation that is specific to a given power system and operating range of interest. This "adaptive linearization" approach minimizes the worst-case error between the outputs of the approximation and the actual nonlinear power flow equations over the operating range of interest. To compute the adaptive linearizations, this paper proposes a constraint generation algorithm that iterates between 1) using a local optimization algorithm to identify a scenario that maximizes the error for the linearization at that iteration and 2) updating the linearization to minimize the worst-case error among all scenarios identified thus far. This approach is tested on several IEEE test cases.

				<span id="qc_voltage_difference2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) is a challenging non-convex optimization problem that plays a crucial role in power system operation and control. Recent applications of convex relaxation methods yield new insights regarding the global optimality of AC OPF solutions. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is one promising approach that constructs convex envelopes around the trigonometric and product terms in the polar representation of the power flow equations. Since the tightness of these envelopes (and thus the quality of the overall QC relaxation) depends on the range of the specified bounds on voltage magnitudes and angle differences, bound tightening techniques have been proposed to strengthen the QC relaxation. Leveraging similar bound tightening techniques, this abstract studies an approach for further strengthening the QC relaxation. Specifically, the QC relaxation is augmented with new variables that represent the voltage magnitude differences between neighboring buses. For many OPF problems, applying bound tightening techniques yields bounds on the voltage magnitude differences between neighboring buses that are significantly tighter than the best-achievable bounds on the voltage magnitudes themselves. Constraints based on the voltage magnitude differences are thus capable of strengthening the QC relaxation.

				<span id="empirical_nonconvexity2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Optimal power flow (OPF) is a central problem in the operation of electric power systems. An OPF problem optimizes a specified objective function subject to constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. Despite these non-convexities, local solution algorithms actually find the global optima of some practical OPF problems. This suggests that OPF problems have a range of difficulty: some problems appear to have convex or "nearly convex" feasible spaces in terms of the voltage magnitudes and power injections, while other problems can exhibit significant non-convexities. Understanding this range of problem difficulty is helpful for creating new test cases for algorithmic benchmarking purposes. Leveraging recently developed computational tools for exploring OPF feasible spaces, this paper first describes an empirical study that aims to characterize non-convexities for small OPF problems. This paper then proposes and analyzes several medium-size test cases that challenge a variety of solution algorithms.

				<span id="opf_spaces2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The solution to an optimal power flow (OPF) problem provides a minimum cost operating point for an electric power system. The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm that is guaranteed to compute the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, "bound tightening" and "grid pruning" algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem. The proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.

				<span id="acqp_socp2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod	OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation’s solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of 8 time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time and solution quality.

					A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.

				<span id="allerton2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					With increasing communication and control capabilities, future power systems will be able to exploit large quantities of responsive loads. Significant research efforts have focused on using loads to improve frequency stability by temporal load shifting. Recent work proposed using fast-acting loads to improve voltage stability via "virtual" spatial load shifting, which does not change their physical location but alters the locational distribution of power consumption in one time period with a payback of the energy in a following time period. Total power demand remains constant across the time periods such that frequency stability is unaffected. The recent work developed an optimization algorithm to determine load control actions that maximize the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, a measure of voltage stability. Proper representation of loads is particularly important in power system stability analyses. Accordingly, this paper studies the impact of load models on the algorithm. Specifically, this paper compares between a constant power load model and a composite load model consisting of both ZIP components and an induction machine model. Using the IEEE 30-bus system as an illustrative example, the results show that different load models have little impact on the maximum-achievable smallest singular value. Furthermore, modeling the load as a constant impedance load results in the maximum smallest singular value.

					Many power system optimization problems are inherently affected by uncertainty, as it is generally impossible to exactly forecast load or renewable generation. Finding solutions that lead to low-cost, yet secure operation for a range of conditions is an important concern to system operators. This paper considers an iterative algorithm for solving power system optimization problems that include models of uncertainty and AC power flow physics. This algorithm iterates between solving deterministic nonlinear optimization problems with the AC power flow model and updating constraint tightenings that adjust the constraints to facilitate secure operation. Decoupling the uncertainty and the nonlinear optimization steps provides several advantages, such as tractability for large-scale problems and the ability to separately apply state-of-the-art techniques for handling the uncertainty and the nonlinearity. Using numerical examples and theoretical analyses, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of the iterative algorithm in solving general power system optimization problems. This paper further characterizes the behavior of the iterative algorithm with respect to convergence, optimality, and infeasibility, and suggests several modifications to improve performance.

				<span id="powertech2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Electric power systems with high penetrations of fluctuating renewable generation may operate close to their stability limits. Demand response can be used to improve power system stability. For example, it is already used to provide frequency control, improving frequency stability. This paper presents a new demand response strategy that uses fast-acting flexible loads to change the loading pattern while keeping the total load constant, improving steady-state voltage stability without affecting the system frequency. The new loading pattern is maintained only for a short period of time until the generators can be re-dispatched. Our goal is to find a permissible loading pattern that maximizes the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, which serves as a measure of voltage stability. The corresponding non-convex optimization problem is solved with an iterative linear programming approach that uses eigenvalue sensitivities and a linearization of the AC power flow equations. Using two IEEE test cases as illustrative examples, we show that the loading patterns resulting from the proposed approach give smallest singular values that are very close to those obtained from a brute force search. The results are also compared to another voltage stability measure given by the maximum loading margin for uniformly varying power injections.

				<span id="illustrative_example2016_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. This paper uses the example problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization and a related "mixed semidefinite/second-order cone programming" hierarchy.

				<span id="cdc2016_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under "normal" operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are "small". However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks. Our experimental results show that the bounds are reasonably tight (i.e., there are points within the domain of interest that are close to achieving the bound) over a range of operating conditions.

					The power flow equations, which relate power injections and voltage phasors, are at the heart of many electric power system computations. While Newton-based methods typically find the "high-voltage" solution to the power flow equations, which is of primary interest, there are potentially many "low-voltage" solutions that are useful for certain analyses. This paper addresses the number of solutions to the power flow equations. There exist upper bounds on the number of power flow solutions; however, there is only limited work regarding bounds that are functions of network topology. This paper empirically explores the relationship between the network topology, as characterized by the maximal cliques, and the number of power flow solutions. To facilitate this analysis, we use a numerical polynomial homotopy continuation approach that is guaranteed to find all complex solutions to the power flow equations. The number of solutions obtained from this approach upper bounds the number of real solutions. Testing with many small networks informs the development of upper bounds that are functions of the network topology. Initial results include empirically derived expressions for the maximum number of solutions for certain classes of network topologies.

					The power flow equations are at the core of most of the computations for designing and operating electric grids. This system of multivariate nonlinear equations relate the power injections and voltages in an electric power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to solve these equations, from Newton-based methods to homotopy continuation and other optimization-based methods. Although many of these methods often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution, challenges remain for finding low-voltage solutions, which play significant roles in certain stability-related computations. While we do not claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods, this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in power flow solution methods to the wider power systems community as well as bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization communities to power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the traditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we focus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, Gr&ouml;bner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using semidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an upper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review the current status of research in this direction.

					Reliable power system operation requires maintaining sufficient voltage stability margins. Traditional techniques based on continuation and optimization calculate lower bounds for these margins and generally require appropriate initialization. Building on a previous semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation, this paper proposes a new second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation which directly yields upper bounds for the voltage stability margin without needing to specify an initialization. Augmentation with integer-constrained variables enables consideration of reactive-power-limited generators. Further, leveraging the ability to globally solve these problems, this paper describes a sufficient condition for insolvability of the power flow equations. Trade-offs between tightness and computational speed of the SDP and SOCP relaxations are studied using large test cases representing portions of European power systems.

					The power flow equations model the steady-state relationship between the power injections and voltage phasors in an electric power system. By separating the real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors, the power flow equations can be formulated as a system of quadratic polynomials. Only the real solutions to these polynomial equations are physically meaningful. This paper focuses on the maximum number of real solutions to the power flow equations. The literature provides upper bounds on the number of real power flow solutions based on the maximum number of complex solutions. There exist two- and three-bus systems which have as many real solutions as the upper bounds given by the maximum number of complex solutions. It is an open question whether this is also the case for larger systems. This paper uses a conjecture and recent algorithmic developments from Galois group theory to suggest a negative answer to this question. Specifically, this paper studies a generic four-bus system composed of PV buses. If a conjecture in Galois group theory holds, the maximum number of real power flow solutions for this system is upper bounded by 16, which is strictly less than 20, the maximum number of complex solutions. This paper also provides parameter values for this system which give rise to 16 real solutions, so this upper bound is achievable.

					Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in "tighter" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.

Large problems with more general objective functions have thus far been computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment relaxations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the combination of an objective function penalization with the moment relaxations. This combination yields feasible points with objective function values that are close to the global optimum of several large OPF problems. Compared to an existing penalization method, the combination of penalization and the moment relaxations eliminates the need to specify one of the penalty parameters and solves a broader class of problems.

				<span id="naps2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Large-scale electric power system analysis depends upon representation of vast numbers of components whose individual models must be populated with parameters. The challenge of populating such component models is particularly apparent in optimal power flow applications, in which incorrect parameters and/or constraint limits can yield overall system representations with either unrealistically large feasible regions or an empty feasible set. Unfortunately, many data sets, particularly those of publicly available test cases, were originally developed to illustrate simpler "power flow only" applications, and may contain unrealistic values or wholly omit important constraint limits. This paper describes engineering-based approaches to obtain credible estimates for parameters and limits associated with line-flow constraints and generator capability curves, as may be employed in a number of steady state analyses such as the optimal power flow. These can substitute for missing or unrealistic data in test systems for which more fully detailed, "real-world" component specifications and limits are not available, and thereby make such test systems more valuable as research tools.

				<span id="powertech2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, convex "moment" relaxations developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems have been shown capable of globally solving many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The moment relaxations, which take the form of semidefinite programs (SDP), generalize a previous SDP relaxation of the OPF problem. This paper presents an approach for improving the computational performance of the moment relaxations for many problems. This approach enforces second-order cone programming (SOCP) constraints that establish necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for satisfaction of the SDP constraints arising from the higher-order moment relaxations. The resulting "mixed SDP/SOCP" formulation implements the first-order relaxation using SDP constraints and the higher-order relaxations using SOCP constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that this mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation is capable of solving many problems for which the first-order moment relaxation fails to yield a global solution. For several examples, the mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation improves computational speed by factors from 1.13 to 18.7.

				<span id="iscas2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the semidefinite relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the semidefinite relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the semidefinite relaxation can be related to  physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The semidefinite relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the semidefinite relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics.

						Recent applications of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem offers a polynomial time method to compute a global optimum for a large subclass of OPF problems. In contrast, prior OPF solution methods in the literature guarantee only local optimality for the solution produced. However, solvers employing SDP relaxation remain significantly slower than mature OPF solution codes. This letter seeks to combine the advantages of the two methods. In particular, we develop a SDP-inspired sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution. This test may then be easily applied to a candidate solution generated by a traditional, only-guaranteed-locally-optimal OPF solver.

						Power system planning and operation offers multitudinous opportunities for optimization methods. In practice, these problems are generally large-scale, non-linear, subject to uncertainties, and combine both continuous and discrete variables. In the recent years, a number of complementary theoretical advances in addressing such problems have been obtained in the field of applied mathematics. The paper introduces a selection of these advances in the fields of non-convex optimization, in mixed-integer programming, and in optimization under uncertainty. The practical relevance of these developments for power systems planning and operation are discussed, and the opportunities for combining them, together with high-performance computing and big data  infrastructures, as well as novel machine learning and randomized algorithms, are highlighted.

						Recently, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations has been applied to the optimal power flow problem. When this relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero duality gap), a globally optimal solution is obtained. Existing literature investigates sufficient conditions whose satisfaction guarantees zero duality gap solutions. However, there is limited study of non-zero duality gap solutions. By illustrating the feasible spaces for optimal power flow problems and their semidefinite relaxations, this paper investigates examples of nonzero duality gap solutions. Results for large system models suggest that non-convexities associated with small subsections of the network are responsible for non-zero duality gap solutions.

						The Electric Power Grid is a critical infrastructure upon which the nation relies for delivery of much of its energy use.  It supports the needs of industry, commerce, and consumer end use. Reliability and economic efficiency are essentials.  Disruptions are inconvenient and can be very costly. The research presented here is directed towards optimal use of grid resources to ensure reliability and minimize cost. The analysis and optimization needs for planning and operation of the electric power system are challenging to meet due to the scale and form of model representations. The connected network spans the continent and the mathematical models are inherently nonlinear. Traditionally, computational limits have necessitated the use of very simplified models for grid analysis, and this has resulted in either less secure operation, or less efficient operation, or both. The research conducted in this project advances techniques for power system optimization problems that will enhance reliable and efficient operation. The results of this work appear in numerous publications and address different application problems include Optimal Power Flow (OPF) [8, 9, 15, 52, 53], unit commitment [41], demand response [46, 49], reliability margins [32, 33, 38], planning [42, 47, 48], transmission expansion [50, 51], and general tools and algorithms [43, 44, 45]. Importantly, the research has been successfully transferred into the practical application domain by its inclusion in the most recent release of the widely-used MATPOWER suite of power system analysis tools.

						The application of semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem has recently attracted significant research interest. This paper provides advances in modeling and computation required for solving the OPF problem for large-scale, general power system models. Specifically, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the OPF problem is presented that incorporates multiple generators at the same bus and parallel lines. Recent research in matrix completion techniques that decompose a single large matrix constrained to be positive semidefinite into many smaller matrices has made solution of OPF problems using semidefinite programming computationally tractable for large system models. We provide three advances to existing decomposition techniques: a matrix combination algorithm that further decreases solver time, a modification to an existing decomposition technique that extends its applicability to general power system networks, and a method for obtaining the optimal voltage profile from the solution to a decomposed semidefinite program.

						In the field of power system engineering, the optimal power flow problem is essential in planning and operations. With increasing system size and complexity, the computational requirements needed to solve practical optimal power flow problems continues to grow. Increasing computational requirements make the possibility of performing these computations remotely with cloud computing appealing. However, power system structure and component values are often confidential; therefore, the problem cannot be shared. To address this issue of confidential information in cloud computing, some techniques for masking optimization problems have been developed. The work of this paper builds upon these techniques for optimization problems but is specifically developed for addressing the DC and AC optimal power flow problems.

As a byproduct, this condition yields a voltage stability margin to the power flow solvability boundary. The second condition formulates the power flow equations, including generator reactive power limits, as a system of polynomials and uses real algebraic geometry and sum of squares programming to create infeasibility certificates which prove power flow insolvability.

						Motivated by the potential for improvements in electric power system economics and reliability, this dissertation investigates applications of a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations, which model the steady-state relationship between power injections and voltages in a power system. In contrast to other optimal power flow solution techniques, semidefinite program solvers can reliably find a global optimum in polynomial time when the semidefinite relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero relaxation gap). Semidefinite relaxations have been applied to a variety of computationally difficult problems in many fields. The power systems literature details limited success in applying semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which minimizes operating cost under engineering and network constraints. Semidefinite programming holds significant promise for application to other power systems problems.</br></br>

						This dissertation first investigates power system economics using a semidefinite relaxation of the OPF problem. In contrast to claims in the literature, this dissertation shows that the semidefinite relaxation may fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., the solution has non-zero relaxation gap) for some practical problems. This dissertation also provides computational and modeling advances required for solving large-scale, realistic OPF problems. Modeling advances include allowing multiple generators at the same bus; parallel transmission lines and transformers; and an approximate method for modeling constant impedance, constant current, constant power (ZIP) loads. Existing methods exploit system sparsity to speed computation using matrix completion techniques that decompose the large positive semidefinite matrix constraint into constraints on many smaller matrices. Computational advances include modifying the matrix decomposition techniques for further reductions in solver times, extending the applicability of an existing decomposition, and a method for obtaining an optimal voltage profile from a solution to a decomposed semidefinite program. This dissertation also provides a sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution obtained by any method.</br></br>

						This dissertation next provides techniques for improving power system reliability. The first reliability-related research develops a sufficient condition under which the power flow equations have no solution. This sufficient condition is evaluated using a feasible semidefinite optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solvability boundary. This distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins. A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); this dissertation additionally introduces a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages. This dissertation considers generators modeled as ideal voltage sources and generators with reactive power limits, which require either mixed-integer semidefinite programming or sum of squares programming formulations.</br></br>

						Also related to power system reliability is the problem of finding multiple solutions to the power flow equations. Power systems typically operate at a high-voltage, stable power flow solution; however, other solutions are used for stability calculations. Existing literature claims that a continuation-based algorithm can reliably find all power flow solutions. This claim is demonstrated to be incorrect with a small counterexample system. Thus, no computationally tractable algorithms exist for reliably finding all power flow solutions. Methods for calculating multiple power flow solutions therefore deserve further research. This dissertation describes a method for finding multiple power flow solutions using semidefinite programming. Results suggest the method's promise for identifying large numbers of power flow solutions.</br></br>

						Although the semidefinite relaxation of the power flow equations is often "tight," non-zero relaxation gap solutions can occur. This dissertation investigates examples of non-zero relaxation gap solutions to semidefinite formulations for the optimal power flow problem, for the power flow insolvability condition, and for determining multiple solutions to the power flow equations.

						In the field of power system engineering, the optimal power flow problem is essential in planning and operations. With increasing system size and complexity, the computational requirements needed to solve practical optimal power flow problems continues to grow. Increasing computational requirements make the possibility of performing these computations remotely with cloud computing appealing. However, power system structure and component values are often confidential; therefore, the problem cannot be shared. To address this issue of confidential information in cloud computing, some techniques for masking optimization problems have been developed. The work of this paper builds upon these techniques for optimization problems but is specifically developed for addressing the DC and AC optimal power flow problems. We study the application of masking a sample OPF using the IEEE 14-bus network.

						Although financial transmissions rights (FTRs) are intended to allow physical participants in electricity markets to hedge the locational price risk associated with their bilateral contracts, both physical participants and speculators take part in FTR auctions. While speculators likely increase the liquidity of FTR auction markets, physical participants and ultimately ratepayers bear the cost of the profits made by speculators. Given the regulated nature of physical participants in contrast to the largely unregulated speculators, it is hypothesized that speculators in FTR auction markets are obtaining substantial profits at the expense of physical participants. This study details a statistical model for characterizing market participants in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) FTR auctions as either speculators or physical participants. Estimates of the total profit made by speculators and measures of the liquidity provided by speculators in FTR auctions are then determined. A sensitivity analysis is used to provide reasonable bounds for these estimates. The best estimates determined in this analysis show speculator profits of 152% of total market profits, equal to $283 million over three years, with speculator transactions accounting for 74% of total market transactions on a megawatt basis.

						The application of semidefinite programming (SDP) to power system problems has recently attracted substantial research interest. Specifically, a recent SDP formulation offers a convex relaxation to the well-known, typically nonconvex "optimal power flow" (OPF) problem. This new formulation was demonstrated to yield zero duality gap for several standard power systems test cases, thereby ensuring a globally optimal OPF solution in each. The first goal of the work here is to investigate this SDP algorithm for the OPF, and show by example that it can fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., it has a nonzero duality gap) in some scenarios of practical interest. The remainder of this paper investigates a SDP approach utilizing modified objective and constraints to compute all solutions of the nonlinear power flow equations. Several variants are described. Results suggest SDP's promise as an efficient algorithm for identifying large numbers of solutions to the power flow equations.

						The Electricity Modernization Act of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the creation of enforceable reliability standards for users, owners, and operators of the “Bulk-Power System” (BPS). This paper introduces an algorithm based on electrical properties of an electric power network that yields a numeric ranking of its branch elements, as a step towards identifying which elements should be considered part of the BPS. This ranking depends solely on network topology and element electrical characteristics, and is wholly independent of generator cost functions and system operating point. Two perspectives for deriving and justifying this ranking algorithm are described: one based on the sensitivity of bus-to-branch Lagrange multipliers and another based on generation shift factors. Summary results obtained from applying the algorithm to a detailed model of the US Eastern Interconnection are reported (with suitable anonymity for any facility specific data, in keeping with Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) protections).

						Eigenvalue problems incorporate multiplicative nonlinearities in otherwise linear equations. Two power systems problems with multiplicative nonlinearities are reformulated as eigenvalue problems. Reformulation allows for the application of eigenvalue theory and solution techniques to these problems.</br></br>

						The first problem involves determination of the initial conditions for induction machine internal variables in a non-linear dynamic power system analysis. The internal variables of stator and rotor currents, rotor speed, and mechanical torque must be determined from the given values of input real power, stator voltage magnitude, and stator voltage angle. This problem is posed in an eigenvalue formulation that can be solved using standard linear algebra techniques. The eigenvalue formulation allows for determination of all possible solutions for the internal variables rather than the single solution obtained from traditional iterative methods. Additionally, the absence of non-zero real eigenvalues indicates that the problem has no solution. Both single-cage and double-cage induction machine models are considered, and numeric examples are presented.</br></br>

						The second problem involves reformulation of the power flow equations as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem. In this formulation, both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are composed of the d and q orthogonal components of the bus voltages. The two parameter formulation of the power flow equations for two bus systems can be solved directly by decomposing the problem into two generalized eigenvalue problems that must be simultaneously satisfied. Since n bus systems require 2(n-1) parameter eigenvalue problems, which do not yet have a general solution method for n > 2, systems with more than two buses are not yet directly solvable from the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation.</br></br>

						In addition to direct solution, two other research avenues for the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations are pursued. First, motivated by eigenvalue problem structure, a reformulation of the multiparameter eigenvalue form of the power flow equations is presented. Although it is without known practical applications, this reformulation and the intermediate results in its derivation are interesting from a theoretical standpoint. Second, an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is performed on the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations. The linearization obtained from the eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is equivalent to the linearization obtained from the power flow Jacobian.</br></br>

						Future developments in multiparameter eigenvalue theory may provide additional insights into solutions of the power flow equations. General solution techniques for multiparameter eigenvalue problems with more than two parameters may enable direct solution of the power flow equations. A method for determining the number of solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful as a stopping condition for continuation power flows. Conditions for the existence of any solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful for finding the point of voltage collapse and for analyzing power systems in heavily loaded conditions.

				<span id="kuramoto2017_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, n, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of n. For these, the equilibria can be located by solving a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. Typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions, corresponding to equilibria of the model, are of physical interest. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to locate only all equilibria of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system.  We compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.

					The potential for cyberattacks is an emerging challenge to maintaining reliable and economic operation of electric power systems. Possible cyberattacks include intrusions to the parameter data at a control center. In this class of attacks, algorithms at the control center are correctly executed, but the attacker's modification of the associated parameter data yields improper results. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and characterizing cyberattacks to the network parameter data, with specific application to optimal power flow problems. The proposed algorithm evaluates whether historical operating point data are consistent with the network parameters. Inconsistencies indicating potential cyberattacks are characterized using historical operational data (power injections and voltage phasors) along with network parameter data. Simulated test cases illustrate the  proposed algorithm's detection and characterization capabilities.

				<span id="large_scale_polyopt2017_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					We propose general notions to deal with large scale polynomial optimization problems and demonstrate their efficiency on a key industrial problem of the twenty first century, namely the optimal power flow problem. These notions enable us to find global minimizers on instances with up to 4,500 variables and 14,500 constraints. First, we generalize the Lasserre hierarchy from real to complex to numbers in order to enhance its tractability when dealing with complex polynomial optimization. Complex numbers are typically used to represent oscillatory phenomena, which are omnipresent in physical systems. Using the notion of hyponormality in operator theory, we provide a finite convergence criterion which generalizes the Curto-Fialkow conditions of the real Lasserre hierarchy. Second, we introduce the multi-ordered Lasserre hierarchy in order to exploit sparsity in polynomial optimization problems (in real or complex variables) while preserving global convergence. It is based on two ideas: 1) to use a different relaxation order for each constraint, and 2) to iteratively seek a closest measure to the truncated moment data until a measure matches the truncated data. Third and last, we exhibit a block diagonal structure of the Lasserre hierarchy in the presence of commonly encountered symmetries.

					Historically, centrally computed algorithms have been the primary means of power system optimization and control. With increasing penetrations of distributed energy resources requiring optimization and control of power systems with many controllable devices, distributed algorithms have been the subject of significant research interest. This paper surveys the literature of distributed algorithms with applications to optimization and control of power systems. In particular, this paper reviews distributed algorithms for offline solution of optimal power flow (OPF) problems as well as online algorithms for real-time solution of OPF, optimal frequency control, optimal voltage control, and optimal wide-area control problems.

					This paper presents a deterministic approach to compute multiple local extrema for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problems. An elliptical representation of the sphereconfined Fritz John conditions is constructed from a quadratic formulation of the ACOPF problem. Application of a branch tracing method to the elliptical formulation enables the calculation of multiple solutions. Further, a monotone search strategy enhances the computational efficiency of finding multiple local solutions with improved objective values. The proposed approach is first illustrated using two small examples with known feasible spaces. Then, four additional local solutions to a 39-bus system are found using the proposed approach.

					The solution to an optimal power flow (OPF) problem provides a minimum cost operating point for an electric power system. The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm that is guaranteed to compute the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, "bound tightening" and "grid pruning" algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem. The proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.

				<span id="acqp_socp2017_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod	OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation’s solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of 8 time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time and solution quality.

					A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.

					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. This paper uses the example problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization and a related "mixed semidefinite/second-order cone programming" hierarchy.

					Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in "tighter" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.

However, solvers employing SDP relaxation remain significantly slower than mature OPF solution codes. This letter seeks to combine the advantages of the two methods.

					Although financial transmissions rights (FTRs) are intended to allow physical participants in electricity markets to hedge the locational price risk associated with their bilateral contracts, both physical participants and speculators take part in FTR auctions. While speculators likely increase the liquidity of FTR auction markets, physical participants and ultimately ratepayers bear the cost of the profits made by speculators. Given the regulated nature of physical participants in contrast to the largely unregulated speculators, it is hypothesized that speculators in FTR auction markets are obtaining substantial profits at the expense of physical participants. This study details a statistical model for characterizing market participants in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) FTR auctions as either speculators or physical participants. Estimates of the total profit made by speculators and measures of the liquidity provided by speculators in FTR auctions are then determined. A sensitivity analysis is used to provide reasonable bounds for these estimates. The best estimates determined in this analysis show speculator profits of 152% of total market profits, equal to $283 million over three years, with speculator transactions accounting for 74% of total market transactions on a megawatt basis.

These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. Accordingly, developing better understandings of the non-convexities in OPF feasible spaces is relevant to improving solution algorithms and creating OPF test cases for benchmarking purposes. This paper proposes an algorithm that uses local solution techniques to identify and characterize non-convexities in OPF feasible spaces. This algorithm searches for a pair of feasible points such that there exists at least one infeasible point on the line segment connecting these points. Such a pair of points certifies the existence of a non-convexity in the OPF feasible space. Moreover, the constraint violations at the point along the connecting line segment characterize the physical explanation of the non-convexity. Numerical test cases include several small systems as illustrative examples as well as modified IEEE systems.

					With growing penetrations of stochastic renewable generation and the need to accurately model the network physics, optimization problems that explicitly consider uncertainty and the AC power flow equations are becoming increasingly important to the operation of electric power systems. This paper proposes an AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) algorithm which yields an operating point that is guaranteed to be robust to all realizations of stochastic generation within a specified uncertainty set. The algorithm tightens the constraints in the original AC OPF problem in order to determine an operating point that accommodates fluctuations due to uncertain generation by iterating between two steps: 1) solving a deterministic AC OPF problem with tightened constraint limits, and 2) using convex relaxation techniques to obtain conservative bounds on updated constraint tightenings which ensure that any realization within the uncertainty set will not result in violation of the operational constraints. Additionally, satisfaction of a sufficient condition for power flow solvability related to the static transfer stability limits completes the algorithm's robust feasibility guarantee. The algorithm is demonstrated using a small illustrative example and applied to several IEEE test cases.

					The power flow equations are at the heart of many optimization and control problems relevant to electric power systems. The nonlinearity of these equations leads to computational challenges, such as non-convexity. Accordingly, various linearization techniques are often used to approximate the power flow equations. In contrast to the wide variety of general linearization techniques in the power systems literature, this paper computes a linear approximation that is specific to a given power system and operating range of interest. This "adaptive linearization" approach minimizes the worst-case error between the outputs of the approximation and the actual nonlinear power flow equations over the operating range of interest. To compute the adaptive linearizations, this paper proposes a constraint generation algorithm that iterates between 1) using a local optimization algorithm to identify a scenario that maximizes the error for the linearization at that iteration and 2) updating the linearization to minimize the worst-case error among all scenarios identified thus far. This approach is tested on several IEEE test cases.

				<span id="qc_voltage_difference2017_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) is a challenging non-convex optimization problem that plays a crucial role in power system operation and control. Recent applications of convex relaxation methods yield new insights regarding the global optimality of AC OPF solutions. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is one promising approach that constructs convex envelopes around the trigonometric and product terms in the polar representation of the power flow equations. Since the tightness of these envelopes (and thus the quality of the overall QC relaxation) depends on the range of the specified bounds on voltage magnitudes and angle differences, bound tightening techniques have been proposed to strengthen the QC relaxation. Leveraging similar bound tightening techniques, this abstract studies an approach for further strengthening the QC relaxation. Specifically, the QC relaxation is augmented with new variables that represent the voltage magnitude differences between neighboring buses. For many OPF problems, applying bound tightening techniques yields bounds on the voltage magnitude differences between neighboring buses that are significantly tighter than the best-achievable bounds on the voltage magnitudes themselves. Constraints based on the voltage magnitude differences are thus capable of strengthening the QC relaxation.

				<span id="empirical_nonconvexity2017_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Optimal power flow (OPF) is a central problem in the operation of electric power systems. An OPF problem optimizes a specified objective function subject to constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. Despite these non-convexities, local solution algorithms actually find the global optima of some practical OPF problems. This suggests that OPF problems have a range of difficulty: some problems appear to have convex or "nearly convex" feasible spaces in terms of the voltage magnitudes and power injections, while other problems can exhibit significant non-convexities. Understanding this range of problem difficulty is helpful for creating new test cases for algorithmic benchmarking purposes. Leveraging recently developed computational tools for exploring OPF feasible spaces, this paper first describes an empirical study that aims to characterize non-convexities for small OPF problems. This paper then proposes and analyzes several medium-size test cases that challenge a variety of solution algorithms.

					With increasing communication and control capabilities, future power systems will be able to exploit large quantities of responsive loads. Significant research efforts have focused on using loads to improve frequency stability by temporal load shifting. Recent work proposed using fast-acting loads to improve voltage stability via "virtual" spatial load shifting, which does not change their physical location but alters the locational distribution of power consumption in one time period with a payback of the energy in a following time period. Total power demand remains constant across the time periods such that frequency stability is unaffected. The recent work developed an optimization algorithm to determine load control actions that maximize the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, a measure of voltage stability. Proper representation of loads is particularly important in power system stability analyses. Accordingly, this paper studies the impact of load models on the algorithm. Specifically, this paper compares between a constant power load model and a composite load model consisting of both ZIP components and an induction machine model. Using the IEEE 30-bus system as an illustrative example, the results show that different load models have little impact on the maximum-achievable smallest singular value. Furthermore, modeling the load as a constant impedance load results in the maximum smallest singular value.

					Many power system optimization problems are inherently affected by uncertainty, as it is generally impossible to exactly forecast load or renewable generation. Finding solutions that lead to low-cost, yet secure operation for a range of conditions is an important concern to system operators. This paper considers an iterative algorithm for solving power system optimization problems that include models of uncertainty and AC power flow physics. This algorithm iterates between solving deterministic nonlinear optimization problems with the AC power flow model and updating constraint tightenings that adjust the constraints to facilitate secure operation. Decoupling the uncertainty and the nonlinear optimization steps provides several advantages, such as tractability for large-scale problems and the ability to separately apply state-of-the-art techniques for handling the uncertainty and the nonlinearity. Using numerical examples and theoretical analyses, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of the iterative algorithm in solving general power system optimization problems. This paper further characterizes the behavior of the iterative algorithm with respect to convergence, optimality, and infeasibility, and suggests several modifications to improve performance.

					Electric power systems with high penetrations of fluctuating renewable generation may operate close to their stability limits. Demand response can be used to improve power system stability. For example, it is already used to provide frequency control, improving frequency stability. This paper presents a new demand response strategy that uses fast-acting flexible loads to change the loading pattern while keeping the total load constant, improving steady-state voltage stability without affecting the system frequency. The new loading pattern is maintained only for a short period of time until the generators can be re-dispatched. Our goal is to find a permissible loading pattern that maximizes the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, which serves as a measure of voltage stability. The corresponding non-convex optimization problem is solved with an iterative linear programming approach that uses eigenvalue sensitivities and a linearization of the AC power flow equations. Using two IEEE test cases as illustrative examples, we show that the loading patterns resulting from the proposed approach give smallest singular values that are very close to those obtained from a brute force search. The results are also compared to another voltage stability measure given by the maximum loading margin for uniformly varying power injections.

				<span id="cdc2016_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under "normal" operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are "small". However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks. Our experimental results show that the bounds are reasonably tight (i.e., there are points within the domain of interest that are close to achieving the bound) over a range of operating conditions.

					The power flow equations, which relate power injections and voltage phasors, are at the heart of many electric power system computations. While Newton-based methods typically find the "high-voltage" solution to the power flow equations, which is of primary interest, there are potentially many "low-voltage" solutions that are useful for certain analyses. This paper addresses the number of solutions to the power flow equations. There exist upper bounds on the number of power flow solutions; however, there is only limited work regarding bounds that are functions of network topology. This paper empirically explores the relationship between the network topology, as characterized by the maximal cliques, and the number of power flow solutions. To facilitate this analysis, we use a numerical polynomial homotopy continuation approach that is guaranteed to find all complex solutions to the power flow equations. The number of solutions obtained from this approach upper bounds the number of real solutions. Testing with many small networks informs the development of upper bounds that are functions of the network topology. Initial results include empirically derived expressions for the maximum number of solutions for certain classes of network topologies.

					The power flow equations are at the core of most of the computations for designing and operating electric grids. This system of multivariate nonlinear equations relate the power injections and voltages in an electric power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to solve these equations, from Newton-based methods to homotopy continuation and other optimization-based methods. Although many of these methods often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution, challenges remain for finding low-voltage solutions, which play significant roles in certain stability-related computations. While we do not claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods, this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in power flow solution methods to the wider power systems community as well as bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization communities to power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the traditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we focus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, Gr&ouml;bner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using semidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an upper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review the current status of research in this direction.

					The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes the operating cost of an electric power system. Applications of convex relaxation techniques to the non-convex OPF problem have been of recent interest, including work using the Lasserre hierarchy of "moment" relaxations to globally solve many OPF problems. By preprocessing the network model to eliminate low-impedance lines, this paper demonstrates the capability of the moment relaxations to globally solve large OPF problems that minimize active power losses for portions of several European power systems. Large problems with more general objective functions have thus far been computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment relaxations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the combination of an objective function penalization with the moment relaxations. This combination yields feasible points with objective function values that are close to the global optimum of several large OPF problems. Compared to an existing penalization method, the combination of penalization and the moment relaxations eliminates the need to specify one of the penalty parameters and solves a broader class of problems.

The challenge of populating such component models is particularly apparent in optimal power flow applications, in which incorrect parameters and/or constraint limits can yield overall system representations with either unrealistically large feasible regions or an empty feasible set. Unfortunately, many data sets, particularly those of publicly available test cases, were originally developed to illustrate simpler "power flow only" applications, and may contain unrealistic values or wholly omit important constraint limits. This paper describes engineering-based approaches to obtain credible estimates for parameters and limits associated with line-flow constraints and generator capability curves, as may be employed in a number of steady state analyses such as the optimal power flow. These can substitute for missing or unrealistic data in test systems for which more fully detailed, "real-world" component specifications and limits are not available, and thereby make such test systems more valuable as research tools.

				<span id="powertech2015_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, convex "moment" relaxations developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems have been shown capable of globally solving many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The moment relaxations, which take the form of semidefinite programs (SDP), generalize a previous SDP relaxation of the OPF problem. This paper presents an approach for improving the computational performance of the moment relaxations for many problems. This approach enforces second-order cone programming (SOCP) constraints that establish necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for satisfaction of the SDP constraints arising from the higher-order moment relaxations. The resulting "mixed SDP/SOCP" formulation implements the first-order relaxation using SDP constraints and the higher-order relaxations using SOCP constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that this mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation is capable of solving many problems for which the first-order moment relaxation fails to yield a global solution. For several examples, the mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation improves computational speed by factors from 1.13 to 18.7.

				<span id="iscas2015_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the semidefinite relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the semidefinite relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the semidefinite relaxation can be related to  physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The semidefinite relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the semidefinite relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics.

					Power system planning and operation offers multitudinous opportunities for optimization methods. In practice, these problems are generally large-scale, non-linear, subject to uncertainties, and combine both continuous and discrete variables. In the recent years, a number of complementary theoretical advances in addressing such problems have been obtained in the field of applied mathematics. The paper introduces a selection of these advances in the fields of non-convex optimization, in mixed-integer programming, and in optimization under uncertainty. The practical relevance of these developments for power systems planning and operation are discussed, and the opportunities for combining them, together with high-performance computing and big data  infrastructures, as well as novel machine learning and randomized algorithms, are highlighted.

When this relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero duality gap), a globally optimal solution is obtained. Existing literature investigates sufficient conditions whose satisfaction guarantees zero duality gap solutions. However, there is limited study of non-zero duality gap solutions. By illustrating the feasible spaces for optimal power flow problems and their semidefinite relaxations, this paper investigates examples of nonzero duality gap solutions. Results for large system models suggest that non-convexities associated with small subsections of the network are responsible for non-zero duality gap solutions.

					The application of semidefinite programming (SDP) to power system problems has recently attracted substantial research interest. Specifically, a recent SDP formulation offers a convex relaxation to the well-known, typically nonconvex "optimal power flow" (OPF) problem. This new formulation was demonstrated to yield zero duality gap for several standard power systems test cases, thereby ensuring a globally optimal OPF solution in each. The first goal of the work here is to investigate this SDP algorithm for the OPF, and show by example that it can fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., it has a nonzero duality gap) in some scenarios of practical interest. The remainder of this paper investigates a SDP approach utilizing modified objective and constraints to compute all solutions of the nonlinear power flow equations. Several variants are described. Results suggest SDP's promise as an efficient algorithm for identifying large numbers of solutions to the power flow equations.

This paper introduces an algorithm based on electrical properties of an electric power network that yields a numeric ranking of its branch elements, as a step towards identifying which elements should be considered part of the BPS. This ranking depends solely on network topology and element electrical characteristics, and is wholly independent of generator cost functions and system operating point. Two perspectives for deriving and justifying this ranking algorithm are described: one based on the sensitivity of bus-to-branch Lagrange multipliers and another based on generation shift factors.

					Motivated by the potential for improvements in electric power system economics and reliability, this dissertation investigates applications of a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations, which model the steady-state relationship between power injections and voltages in a power system. In contrast to other optimal power flow solution techniques, semidefinite program solvers can reliably find a global optimum in polynomial time when the semidefinite relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero relaxation gap). Semidefinite relaxations have been applied to a variety of computationally difficult problems in many fields. The power systems literature details limited success in applying semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which minimizes operating cost under engineering and network constraints. Semidefinite programming holds significant promise for application to other power systems problems.</br></br>

					This dissertation first investigates power system economics using a semidefinite relaxation of the OPF problem. In contrast to claims in the literature, this dissertation shows that the semidefinite relaxation may fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., the solution has non-zero relaxation gap) for some practical problems. This dissertation also provides computational and modeling advances required for solving large-scale, realistic OPF problems. Modeling advances include allowing multiple generators at the same bus; parallel transmission lines and transformers; and an approximate method for modeling constant impedance, constant current, constant power (ZIP) loads. Existing methods exploit system sparsity to speed computation using matrix completion techniques that decompose the large positive semidefinite matrix constraint into constraints on many smaller matrices. Computational advances include modifying the matrix decomposition techniques for further reductions in solver times, extending the applicability of an existing decomposition, and a method for obtaining an optimal voltage profile from a solution to a decomposed semidefinite program. This dissertation also provides a sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution obtained by any method.</br></br>

					This dissertation next provides techniques for improving power system reliability. The first reliability-related research develops a sufficient condition under which the power flow equations have no solution. This sufficient condition is evaluated using a feasible semidefinite optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solvability boundary. This distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins. A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); this dissertation additionally introduces a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages. This dissertation considers generators modeled as ideal voltage sources and generators with reactive power limits, which require either mixed-integer semidefinite programming or sum of squares programming formulations.</br></br>

					Also related to power system reliability is the problem of finding multiple solutions to the power flow equations. Power systems typically operate at a high-voltage, stable power flow solution; however, other solutions are used for stability calculations. Existing literature claims that a continuation-based algorithm can reliably find all power flow solutions. This claim is demonstrated to be incorrect with a small counterexample system. Thus, no computationally tractable algorithms exist for reliably finding all power flow solutions. Methods for calculating multiple power flow solutions therefore deserve further research. This dissertation describes a method for finding multiple power flow solutions using semidefinite programming. Results suggest the method's promise for identifying large numbers of power flow solutions.</br></br>

					Although the semidefinite relaxation of the power flow equations is often "tight," non-zero relaxation gap solutions can occur. This dissertation investigates examples of non-zero relaxation gap solutions to semidefinite formulations for the optimal power flow problem, for the power flow insolvability condition, and for determining multiple solutions to the power flow equations.

					Eigenvalue problems incorporate multiplicative nonlinearities in otherwise linear equations. Two power systems problems with multiplicative nonlinearities are reformulated as eigenvalue problems. Reformulation allows for the application of eigenvalue theory and solution techniques to these problems.</br></br>

					The first problem involves determination of the initial conditions for induction machine internal variables in a non-linear dynamic power system analysis. The internal variables of stator and rotor currents, rotor speed, and mechanical torque must be determined from the given values of input real power, stator voltage magnitude, and stator voltage angle. This problem is posed in an eigenvalue formulation that can be solved using standard linear algebra techniques. The eigenvalue formulation allows for determination of all possible solutions for the internal variables rather than the single solution obtained from traditional iterative methods. Additionally, the absence of non-zero real eigenvalues indicates that the problem has no solution. Both single-cage and double-cage induction machine models are considered, and numeric examples are presented.</br></br>

					The second problem involves reformulation of the power flow equations as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem. In this formulation, both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are composed of the d and q orthogonal components of the bus voltages. The two parameter formulation of the power flow equations for two bus systems can be solved directly by decomposing the problem into two generalized eigenvalue problems that must be simultaneously satisfied. Since n bus systems require 2(n-1) parameter eigenvalue problems, which do not yet have a general solution method for n > 2, systems with more than two buses are not yet directly solvable from the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation.</br></br>

					In addition to direct solution, two other research avenues for the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations are pursued. First, motivated by eigenvalue problem structure, a reformulation of the multiparameter eigenvalue form of the power flow equations is presented. Although it is without known practical applications, this reformulation and the intermediate results in its derivation are interesting from a theoretical standpoint. Second, an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is performed on the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations. The linearization obtained from the eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is equivalent to the linearization obtained from the power flow Jacobian.</br></br>

					Future developments in multiparameter eigenvalue theory may provide additional insights into solutions of the power flow equations. General solution techniques for multiparameter eigenvalue problems with more than two parameters may enable direct solution of the power flow equations. A method for determining the number of solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful as a stopping condition for continuation power flows. Conditions for the existence of any solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful for finding the point of voltage collapse and for analyzing power systems in heavily loaded conditions.

					The power flow equations model the steady-state relationship between the power injections and voltage phasors in an electric power system. By separating the real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors, the power flow equations can be formulated as a system of quadratic polynomials. Only the real solutions to these polynomial equations are physically meaningful. This paper focuses on the maximum number of real solutions to the power flow equations. The literature provides upper bounds on the number of real power flow solutions based on the maximum number of complex solutions. There exist two- and three-bus systems which have as many real solutions as the upper bounds given by the maximum number of complex solutions. It is an open question whether this is also the case for larger systems. This paper uses a conjecture and recent algorithmic developments from Galois group theory to suggest a negative answer to this question. Specifically, this paper studies a generic four-bus system composed of PV buses. If a conjecture in Galois group theory holds, the maximum number of real power flow solutions for this system is upper bounded by 16, which is strictly less than 20, the maximum number of complex solutions. This paper also provides parameter values for this system which give rise to 16 real solutions, so this upper bound is achievable.

					The Electric Power Grid is a critical infrastructure upon which the nation relies for delivery of much of its energy use.  It supports the needs of industry, commerce, and consumer end use. Reliability and economic efficiency are essentials.  Disruptions are inconvenient and can be very costly. The research presented here is directed towards optimal use of grid resources to ensure reliability and minimize cost. The analysis and optimization needs for planning and operation of the electric power system are challenging to meet due to the scale and form of model representations. The connected network spans the continent and the mathematical models are inherently nonlinear. Traditionally, computational limits have necessitated the use of very simplified models for grid analysis, and this has resulted in either less secure operation, or less efficient operation, or both. The research conducted in this project advances techniques for power system optimization problems that will enhance reliable and efficient operation. The results of this work appear in numerous publications and address different application problems include Optimal Power Flow (OPF) [8, 9, 15, 52, 53], unit commitment [41], demand response [46, 49], reliability margins [32, 33, 38], planning [42, 47, 48], transmission expansion [50, 51], and general tools and algorithms [43, 44, 45]. Importantly, the research has been successfully transferred into the practical application domain by its inclusion in the most recent release of the widely-used MATPOWER suite of power system analysis tools.

				The power flow equations relate the power injections and voltages in an electric power system and are therefore key to many power system optimization and control problems. Research efforts have developed a wide variety of relaxations and approximations of the power flow equations with a range of capabilities and characteristics. This monograph surveys relaxations and approximations of the power flow equations, with a particular emphasis on recently proposed formulations.
