				<span id="admittance_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The admittance matrix encodes the network topology and electrical parameters of a power system in order to relate the current injection and voltage phasors. Since admittance matrices are central to many power engineering analyses, their characteristics are important subjects of theoretical studies. This paper focuses on the key characteristic of <i>invertibility</i>. Previous literature has presented an invertibility condition for admittance matrices. This paper first identifies and fixes a technical issue in the proof of this previously presented invertibility condition. This paper then extends this previous work by deriving new conditions that are applicable to a broader class of systems with lossless branches and transformers with off-nominal tap ratios.

				<span id="robustACOPFconvexrestriction_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Electric power grids regularly experience uncertain fluctuations from load demands and renewables, which poses a risk of violating operational limits designed to safeguard the system. In this paper, we consider the robust AC OPF problem that minimizes the generation cost while requiring a certain level of system security in the presence of uncertainty. The robust AC OPF problem requires that the system satisfy operational limits for all uncertainty realizations within a specified uncertainty set. Guaranteeing robustness is particularly challenging due to the non-convex, nonlinear AC power flow equations, which may not always have a solution. In this work, we extend a previously developed convex restriction to a <i>robust convex restriction</i>, which is a convex inner approximation of the non-convex feasible region of the AC OPF problem that accounts for uncertainty in the power injections. We then use the robust convex restriction in an algorithm that obtains robust solutions to AC OPF problems by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. We demonstrate our algorithm and its ability to control robustness versus operating cost trade-offs using PGLib test cases.

				<span id="robust_dc_network_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					With high penetrations of renewable generation and variable loads, there is significant uncertainty associated with power flows in DC networks such that stability and constraint satisfaction are important concerns. Most existing DC network optimal power flow (DN-OPF) formulations assume exact knowledge about loading conditions and do not provide stability guarantees. In contrast, this paper studies a DN-OPF formulation which considers both stability and constraint satisfaction under uncertainty. The need to account for a range of uncertainty realizations in this paper’s robust optimization formulation results in a challenging semi-infinite program (SIP). The proposed solution algorithm reformulates this SIP into a computationally amenable problem whose solution provides a feasible operating point for the SIP. This algorithm constructs a convex stability set using sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible and stable power flow solution. Solving an optimization problem based on this convex stability set provides generator set points which ensure that the DC network has a stable operating point for any considered uncertainty realization. This optimization problem takes a form similar to a deterministic DN-OPF problem and is therefore tractable. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated using various DC networks adapted from IEEE test cases.

				<span id="verifying_opt_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					We propose an approach for verifying that a given feasible point for a polynomial optimization problem is globally optimal. The approach relies on the Lasserre hierarchy and the result of Lasserre regarding the importance of the convexity of the feasible set as opposed to that of the individual constraints. By focusing solely on certifying global optimality and relaxing the Lasserre hierarchy using necessary conditions for positive semidefiniteness based on matrix determinants, the proposed method is implementable as a computationally tractable linear program. We demonstrate this method via application to the optimal power flow problem used to operate electric power systems.

					<span id="covidload_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						To mitigate the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), governments around the world have imposed social distancing policies ranging from minor social activity suspensions to full curfews. These social distancing policies have altered electricity consumption behaviors in numerous countries. This paper studies how strict social distancing policies affect the relationship between electricity demand and ambient temperature. This relationship is especially important since most governments imposed strict social distancing policies during a temperature transition season where the impacts of temperature variations are particularly important for grid operations. In this paper, we first review the expected short- and long-term impacts of social distancing on the electricity demand. We then present a case study on the electricity demand of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during strict social distancing policies. The results of this case study suggest that strict social distancing policies result in a stronger dependency between temperature and electricity demand. Additionally, we observe a reduction in the time required for the electricity demand to respond to temperature changes. Power system regulators can use the results in this paper to better design energy policies and cope with rare events. Additionally, power system operators can use the results in this paper to more accurately forecast electricity demands to avoid inefficient and insecure operation of the electric grid.

					<span id="rqc_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						Optimal power flow (OPF) is a key problem in power system operations. OPF problems that use the nonlinear AC power flow equations to accurately model the network physics have inherent challenges associated with non-convexity. To address these challenges, recent research has applied various convex relaxation approaches to OPF problems. The QC relaxation is a promising approach that convexifies the trigonometric and product terms in the OPF problem by enclosing these terms in convex envelopes. The accuracy of the QC relaxation strongly depends on the tightness of these envelopes. This paper presents two improvements to these envelopes. The first improvement leverages a polar representation of the branch admittances in addition to the rectangular representation used previously. The second improvement is based on a coordinate transformation via a complex per unit base power normalization that rotates the power flow equations. The trigonometric envelopes resulting from this rotation can be tighter than the corresponding envelopes in previous QC relaxation formulations. Using an empirical analysis with a variety of test cases, this paper suggests an appropriate value for the angle of the complex base power. Comparing the results with a state-of-the-art QC formulation reveals the advantages of the proposed improvements.

					<span id="jcc_dcopf_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						Managing uncertainty and variability in power injections has become a major concern for power system operators due to increasing levels of fluctuating renewable energy connected to the grid. This work addresses this uncertainty via a joint chance-constrained formulation of the DC optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which satisfies <i>all</i> the constraints <i>jointly</i> with a pre-determined probability. The few existing approaches for solving joint chance-constrained OPF problems are typically either computationally intractable for large-scale problems or give overly conservative solutions that satisfy the constraints far more often than required, resulting in excessively costly operation. This paper proposes an algorithm for solving joint chance-constrained DC OPF problems by adopting an S&#8467;<sub>1</sub>QP-type trust-region algorithm. This algorithm uses a sample-based approach that avoids making strong assumptions on the distribution of the uncertainties, scales favorably to large problems, and can be tuned to obtain less conservative results. We illustrate the performance of our method using several IEEE test cases. The results demonstrate the proposed algorithm's advantages in computational times and limited conservativeness of the solutions relative to other joint chance-constrained DC OPF algorithms.

						Advances in data-driven methods have sparked renewed interest for applications in power systems. Creating datasets for successful application of these methods has proven to be very challenging, especially when considering power system security. This paper proposes a computationally efficient method to create datasets of secure and insecure operating points. We propose an infeasibility certificate based on separating hyperplanes that can a-priori characterize large parts of the input space as insecure, thus significantly reducing both computation time and problem size. Our method can handle an order of magnitude more control variables and creates balanced datasets of secure and insecure operating points, which is essential for data-driven applications. While we focus on N-1 security and uncertainty, our method can extend to dynamic security. For PGLib-OPF networks up to 500 buses and up to 125 control variables, we demonstrate drastic reductions in unclassified input space volumes and computation time, create balanced datasets, and evaluate an illustrative data-driven application.

						In distribution systems, power injection variability due to growing penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) and dispatchable loads can lead to power quality issues such as severe voltage unbalance. To ensure safe operation of	phase-balance-sensitive components such as transformers and	induction motor loads, the amount of voltage unbalance must be maintained within specified limits for a range of uncertain loading conditions. This paper builds on existing "solvability conditions" that characterize operating regions for which the power flow equations are guaranteed to have a unique high-voltage solution.	We extend these existing solvability conditions to be applicable to distribution systems and augment them with a “balancibility” condition which quantifies an operating region within which a unique, adequately balanced power flow solution exists. To	build this condition, we consider different unbalance definitions	and derive closed-form representations through reformulations or	safe approximations. Using case studies, we evaluate these closed-form representations and compare the balancibility conditions	associated with different unbalance definitions.

						The Fast Decoupled Power Flow (FDPF) method has been widely adopted due to its computational speed advantages relative to the Newton-Raphson method for many practically relevant power flow problems. The FDPF method relies on the assumption that the lines are highly inductive, i.e., have small R/X ratios. When this assumption does not hold (e.g., for distribution systems and some subtransmission systems), the FDPF method may exhibit slow convergence or fail to converge entirely. To address such cases, previous work has proposed an <i>axis rotation</i> method which rescales the complex power injections and the bus admittances by a unit-magnitude complex scalar parameter. Since this complex parameter adjusts the lines' R/X ratios, an appropriate choice for this parameter can improve the FDPF method's performance. In contrast to previous work that only introduces one complex parameter for the entire system (or one complex parameter per large subsystem), we propose and analyze an axis rotation method that introduces different complex parameters at each bus. The additional degrees of freedom provided in this more granular approach are particularly valuable for systems where the lines have wider ranges of R/X ratios. To obtain appropriate values for the complex parameters, we propose to minimize the sum of the squared errors associated with the FDPF approximations. This method can also be adapted for cases with large voltage angle differences. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

						Distributed algorithms provide attractive features for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in interconnected power systems compared to traditional centralized algorithms. Distributed algorithms help to maintain the control autonomy and data privacy of subsystems, which is particularly relevant in competitive markets and practical control system implementations. This paper analyzes a distributed optimization algorithm known as the "Auxiliary Principle Problem" to solve multiperiod distributed DCOPF problems with energy storage systems. The proposed approach enables multiple interconnected systems with their own sub-objectives to share their resources and to participate in an electricity market without implicitly sharing information about their local generators or internal network parameters. The paper also shows how the proposed approach can enable future microgrids to coordinate their operation, reduce the total operational cost, and avoid internal constraint violations caused by unscheduled flows (USF) while maintaining the subsystems’ autonomy. We used an 11-bus test system consisting of two interconnected subsystems to evaluate the proposed approach and analyze the impact of USF.

					<span id="inexact_relaxations_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Convex relaxations of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems have attracted significant interest as in several instances they provably yield the global optimum to the original non-convex problem. If, however, the relaxation is inexact, the obtained solution is not AC-feasible. The quality of the obtained solution is essential for several practical applications of AC-OPF, but detailed analyses are lacking in existing literature. This paper aims to cover this gap. We provide an in-depth investigation of the solution characteristics when convex relaxations are inexact, we assess the most promising AC feasibility recovery methods for large-scale systems, and we propose two new metrics that lead to a better understanding of the quality of the identified solutions. We perform a comprehensive assessment on 96 different test cases, ranging from 14 to 3120 buses, and we show the following: (i) Despite an optimality gap of less than 1%, several test cases still exhibit substantial distances to both AC feasibility and local optimality and the newly proposed metrics characterize these deviations. (ii) Penalization methods fail to recover an AC-feasible solution in 15 out of 45 test cases. (iii) The computational benefits of warm-starting non-convex solvers have significant variation, but a computational speedup exists in over 75% of the test cases.

						Nonconvexity induced by the nonlinear AC power flow equations challenges solution algorithms for AC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. While significant research efforts have focused on reliably computing high-quality OPF solutions, it is not always clear that there exists a feasible path to reach the desired operating point. Transitioning between operating points while avoiding constraint violations can be challenging since the feasible space of the OPF problem is nonconvex and potentially disconnected. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm that computes a provably feasible path from an initial operating point to a desired operating point. Given an initial feasible point, the algorithm solves a sequence of convex quadratically constrained optimization problems over conservative convex inner approximations of the OPF feasible space. In each iteration, we obtain a new, improved operating point and a feasible transition from the operating point in the previous iteration. In addition to computing a feasible path to a known desired operating point, this algorithm can also be used to improve the operating point locally. Extensive numerical studies on a variety of test cases demonstrate the algorithm and the ability to arrive at a high-quality solution in few iterations.

						Efficiently and reliably operating electric power grids requires the frequent solution of optimization problems such as the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC OPF) problem. Solution of DC OPF problems can be challenging due to the large number of operational constraints imposed in these problems, especially limits on the line flows. Improving solver times can be facilitated by a better understanding of the active line flow constraints in DC OPF problems (i.e., the inequality constraints limiting line flows that are satisfied with equality at the solution). Considering a variety of test cases and a range of loading scenarios, this paper empirically characterizes the sets of active line flow constraints in DC OPF problems. Among other analyses, the paper compares the sets of redundant line flow constraints (i.e., constraints guaranteed to be inactive) that are identified by previously proposed constraint screening methods to the line flow constraints that are actually observed to be active over a range of scenarios. The results indicate that a large fraction of the line flow constraints which are not identified as being redundant by these screening methods are nevertheless inactive in the DC OPF solutions. This observation suggests the potential for improvements to the constraint screening methods. Laying the groundwork for achieving these improvements, this paper also identifies which line characteristics tend to be associated with active flow constraints and studies the relationships among sets of simultaneously active line flow constraints.

				<span id="SDP_plus_local_solution_for_OPF_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Optimal power flow (OPF) is an important problem in the operation of electric power systems. Due to the OPF problem's non-convexity, there may exist multiple local optima. Certifiably obtaining the global solution is important for certain applications of OPF problems. Many global optimization techniques compute an optimality gap that compares the achievable objective value corresponding to the feasible point from a local solution algorithm with the objective value bound from a convex relaxation technique. Rather than the traditional practice of completely separating the local solution and convex relaxation computations, this paper proposes a method that exploits information from a local solution to speed the computation of an objective value bound using a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The improvement in computational tractability comes with the trade-off of reduced tightness for the resulting objective value bound. Numerical experiments illustrate this trade-off, with the proposed method being faster but weaker than the SDP relaxation and slower but tighter than second-order cone programming (SOCP) and quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for many large test cases.

					The increasing penetration of renewables has driven power systems to operate closer to their stability boundaries, increasing the risk of instability. We propose a multiperiod optimal power flow approach that uses demand responsive loads to improve steady-state voltage stability, which is measured by the smallest singular value (SSV) of the power flow Jacobian matrix. In contrast to past work that employs load shedding to improve stability, our approach improves the SSV by decreasing and increasing individual loads while keeping the total loading constant to avoid fluctuation of the system frequency. Additionally, an energy payback period maintains the total energy consumption of each load at its nominal value. The objective function balances SSV improvements against generation costs in the energy payback period. We develop an iterative linear programming algorithm using singular value sensitivities to obtain an AC-feasible solution. We demonstrate its performance on two IEEE test systems. The results show that demand response actions can improve static voltage stability, in some cases more cost-effectively than generation actions. We also compare our algorithm's performance to that of an iterative nonlinear programming algorithm from the literature. We find that our approach is approximately 6 times faster when applied to the IEEE 9-bus system, allowing us to demonstrate its performance on the IEEE 118-bus system.

					Combating cyberattacks is an emerging challenge in maintaining the reliable and economic operation of electric power systems. Possible cyberattacks include intrusions to the parameter data at a control center. In this class of attacks, algorithms at the control center are correctly executed, but the attacker's modification of the associated parameter data yields improper results. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and characterizing cyberattacks to network parameter data, with specific application to optimal power flow problems. The proposed algorithm evaluates whether historical operating point data are consistent with the network parameters. Inconsistencies indicating potential cyberattacks are characterized using historical operational data (power injections and voltage phasors) along with network parameter data. Simulated test cases illustrate the  proposed algorithm's detection and characterization capabilities.

					<span id="unbalance_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						Growing penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) increase the power injection variability in distribution systems, which can result in power quality issues such as voltage unbalance. To measure unbalance, organizations such as IEC, NEMA and IEEE define phase unbalance in their power quality standards. However, the definitions in these different standards are not consistent, and voltages that are considered acceptable by one standard may violate good practices defined by another standard. To address this issue, this paper provides analytical comparisons of the most common voltage unbalance definitions, which are supplemented with numerical simulations. The analytical relationships suggest that it is possible to approximately bound the symmetrical-component-based voltage unbalance factor (which depends on the magnitude and relative phase angle) by limiting the line-to-line voltage unbalance, whereas applying line-to-ground voltage unbalance definitions neglects all information about phase angle offsets.

					<span id="redundant2019_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						In many power system optimization problems, we observe that only a small fraction of the line flow constraints ever become active at the optimal solution, despite variations in the load profile and generation costs. This observation has far-reaching implications not only for power system optimization, but also for the practical long-term planning, operation, and control of the system. We formalize this empirical observation for problems involving the DC power flow equations. We use a two-step constraint screening approach to identify constraints whose satisfaction is implied by other constraints in the problem. These constraints are redundant and can therefore can be eliminated from the problem. For the first screening step, we derive analytical bounds that quickly identify redundancies in the flow limits on parallel lines. The second screening step uses optimization-based constraint tightening, where we solve a (relaxed) optimization problem for each constraint to identify redundancies. We specifically focus our approach on large ranges of load variation such that the results are valid for long periods of time, thus justifying the computational overhead required for the screening method. Numerical results for a wide variety of standard test cases show that even with load variations up to &plusmn;100% of nominal loading, we are able to eliminate a significant fraction of the flow constraints. This large reduction in constraints may enable a range of possible applications. As one illustrative example, we demonstrate the computational improvements for the unit commitment problem obtained as a result of the reduced number of constraints.

					<span id="powertech2019_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						The nonlinearity of the power flow equations leads to algorithmic and theoretical challenges for a wide variety of optimization and control problems relevant to electric power systems. Solution algorithms for these problems often use linearization techniques to obtain more tractable power flow formulations. Many existing linearizations lack specialization to a given system and operating range of interest, leading to unnecessarily large linearization errors. In contrast, recently proposed "optimal adaptive" linearizations are 1) tailored to specific systems and operating ranges of interest and 2) optimal in the sense that they minimize a selected error metric relative to the nonlinear power flow equations. Previous work proposes optimal adaptive linearizations that minimize the <i>worst-case</i> linearization error. Building on previous work, this paper uses an uncertainty quantifiation method called Polynomial Chaos Expansion to minimize the <i>expected</i> linearization error for a given probability distribution of the power injections. As validated using Monte Carlo analyses, the capabilities of the expected-error-minimizing linearizations are shown to be superior to first-order Taylor approximations computed at a nominal operating point.

					<span id="isgt2019_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						We propose the application of occupation measure theory to the classical problem of transient stability analysis for power systems. This enables the computation of certified inner and outer approximations for the region of attraction of a nominal operating point. In order to determine whether a post-disturbance point requires corrective actions to ensure stability, one would then simply need to check the sign of a polynomial evaluated at that point. Thus, computationally expensive dynamical simulations are only required for post-disturbance points in the region between the inner and outer approximations. We focus on the nonlinear swing equations but voltage dynamics could also be included. The proposed approach is formulated as a hierarchy of semidefinite programs stemming from an infinite-dimensional linear program in a measure space, with a natural dual sum-of-squares perspective. On the theoretical side, this paper lays the groundwork for exploiting the oscillatory structure of power systems by using Hermitian (instead of real) sums-of-squares and connects the proposed approach to recent results from algebraic geometry.

					<span id="hicss2019_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
						Growing penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems have motivated the design of controllers that leverage DER capabilities to achieve system-wide objectives. These controllers may be either <i>grid-agnostic</i> or <i>grid-aware</i>, depending on whether distribution network constraints are considered. Grid-agnostic controllers have the benefit of not requiring network models or system measurements, but may cause dangerous constraint violations. Rather than develop a specific controller, this paper considers the <i>potential impacts</i> of DER controllers with respect to network constraint violations. Specifically, this paper develops an optimization-based method to rigorously certify when any grid-agnostic controller can be applied without concern regarding network constraint violations, or, conversely, when grid-aware control may be needed to maintain distribution grid security. The proposed method uses convex optimization techniques to bound the impacts of load variability, given a subset of buses with voltage measurements and control. The method either provides a certificate for secure operation or identifies potentially critical constraints and the need for additional controllability. Numerical tests illustrate the ability to certify secure operation for different ranges of variability.

However, it is often difficult to directly compare these studies due to subtle differences in the AC-OPF problem formulation as well as the network, generation, and loading data that are used for evaluation. To help address these challenges, this IEEE PES Task Force report proposes a standardized AC-OPF mathematical formulation and the PGLib-OPF networks for benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms. A motivating study demonstrates some limitations of the established network datasets in the context of benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms and a validation study demonstrates the efficacy of using the PGLib-OPF networks for this purpose. In the interest of scientific discourse and future additions, the PGLib-OPF benchmark library is open-access and all the of network data is provided under a creative commons license.

					Optimal power flow (OPF) is an important problem in the operation of electric power systems. The solution to an OPF problem provides a minimum cost operating point that satisfies constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies and characterizes non-convexities in OPF feasible spaces. This algorithm searches for a pair of feasible points whose connecting line segment contains an infeasible point. Such points certify the existence of a non-convexity in the OPF feasible space. Moreover, the constraint violations at the infeasible point along the connecting line segment physically characterize a cause of the non-convexity. Numerical demonstrations include a small illustrative example as well as applications to various test cases.

					We propose general notions to deal with large scale polynomial optimization problems and demonstrate their efficiency on a key industrial problem of the twenty first century, namely the optimal power flow problem. These notions enable us to find global minimizers on instances with up to 4,500 variables and 14,500 constraints. First, we generalize the Lasserre hierarchy from real to complex to numbers in order to enhance its tractability when dealing with complex polynomial optimization. Complex numbers are typically used to represent oscillatory phenomena, which are omnipresent in physical systems. Using the notion of hyponormality in operator theory, we provide a finite convergence criterion which generalizes the Curto-Fialkow conditions of the real Lasserre hierarchy. Second, we introduce the multi-ordered Lasserre hierarchy in order to exploit sparsity in polynomial optimization problems (in real or complex variables) while preserving global convergence. It is based on two ideas: 1) to use a different relaxation order for each constraint, and 2) to iteratively seek a closest measure to the truncated moment data until a measure matches the truncated data. Third and last, we exhibit a block diagonal structure of the Lasserre hierarchy in the presence of commonly encountered symmetries.

					Many power system optimization problems constrain line flows with limits specified in terms of the magnitudes of apparent power or current flows. The set of line-flow constraints may have redundancies (i.e., the feasible space may be unchanged upon removal of a subset of the line-flow constraints), which unnecessarily complicate optimization problems. This letter describes an algorithm for identifying redundant line-flow constraints corresponding to certain parallel lines. After formulating the constraints as ellipsoids in the voltage variables, redundancies are detected from the absence of intersections between pairs of ellipsoids corresponding to parallel lines. This algorithm is demonstrated using several large test cases.

				<span id="kuramoto2017_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, n, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of n. For these, the equilibria can be located by finding the real solutions of a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. However, typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions give equilibria.

					In this paper, we present an algorithm to locate only the real solutions of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. The correctness of the algorithm (that it finds only and all the equilibria) is proved rigorously. Additionally, the algorithm can be implemented using interval methods so that the equilibria can be approximated up to any given precision without significantly more computational effort. We also compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods.

					Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.

				<span id="globalsip2018_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Solutions to optimal power flow (OPF) problems provide operating points for electric power systems that minimize operational costs while satisfying both engineering limits and the power flow equations. OPF problems are non-convex and may have multiple local optima. To search for global optima, recent research has developed a variety of convex relaxations to bound the optimal objective values of OPF problems. Certain relaxations, such as the quadratic convex (QC) relaxation, are derived from OPF representations that contain trilinear monomials. Previous work has considered three techniques for relaxing these trilinear monomials: <i>recursive McCormick</i> (RMC) envelopes, <i>Meyer and Floudas</i> (MF) envelopes, and <i>extreme-point</i> (EP) envelopes. This paper compares the tightness and computational speed of relaxations that employ each of these techniques. Forming the convex hull of a single trilinear monomial, MF and EP envelopes are equivalently tight. Empirical results show that QC formulations using MF and EP envelopes give tighter bounds than those using RMC envelopes. Empirical results also indicate that the EP envelopes have advantages over MF envelopes with respect to computational speed and numerical stability when used with state-of-the-art second-order cone programming solvers.

					Optimal power flow (OPF) is a central problem in the operation of electric power systems. An OPF problem optimizes a specified objective function subject to constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. Despite these non-convexities, local solution algorithms actually find the global optima of some practical OPF problems. This suggests that OPF problems have a range of difficulty: some problems appear to have convex or "nearly convex" feasible spaces in terms of the voltage magnitudes and power injections, while other problems can exhibit significant non-convexities. Understanding this range of problem difficulty is helpful for creating new test cases for algorithmic benchmarking purposes. Leveraging recently developed computational tools for exploring OPF feasible spaces, this paper first describes an empirical study that aims to characterize non-convexities for small OPF problems. This paper then proposes and analyzes several medium-size test cases that challenge a variety of solution algorithms.

					With growing penetrations of stochastic renewable generation and the need to accurately model the network physics, optimization problems that explicitly consider uncertainty and the AC power flow equations are becoming increasingly important to the operation of electric power systems. This paper describes initial steps towards an AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) algorithm which yields an operating point that is guaranteed to be robust to all realizations of stochastic generation within a specified uncertainty set. Ensuring robust feasibility requires overcoming two challenges: 1) ensuring solvability of the power flow equations for all uncertainty realizations and 2) guaranteeing feasibility of the engineering constraints for all uncertainty realizations. This paper primarily focuses on the latter challenge. Specifically, this paper poses the robust AC OPF problem as a bi-level program that maximizes (or minimizes) the constraint values over the uncertainty set, where a convex relaxation of the AC power flow constraints is used to ensure conservativeness. The resulting optimization program is solved using an alternating solution algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated via detailed analyses of two small test cases.

					The power flow equations are at the heart of many optimization and control problems relevant to power systems. The non-linearity of these equations leads to computational challenges in solving power flow and optimal power flow problems (non-convergence, local optima, etc.). Accordingly, various linearization techniques, such as the DC power flow, are often used to approximate the power flow equations. In contrast to a wide variety of general linearization techniques in the power systems literature, this paper computes a linear approximation that is specific to a given power system and operating range of interest. An "adaptive linearization" developed using this approach minimizes the worst-case error between the output of the approximation and the actual non-linear power flow equations over the operating range of interest. To compute an adaptive linearization, this paper proposes a constraint generation algorithm that iterates between 1) using an optimization algorithm to identify a point that maximizes the error of the linearization at that iteration and 2) updating the linearization to minimize the worst-case error among all points identified thus far. This approach is tested on several IEEE test cases, with the results demonstrating up to a factor of four improvement in approximation error over linearizations based on a first-order Taylor approximation.

					AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) is a challenging non-convex optimization problem that plays a crucial role in power system operation and control. Recently developed convex relaxation techniques provide new insights regarding the global optimality of AC OPF solutions. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is one promising approach that constructs convex envelopes around the trigonometric and product terms in the polar representation of the power flow equations. This paper proposes two methods for tightening the QC relaxation. The first method introduces new variables that represent the voltage magnitude differences between connected buses. Using "bound tightening" techniques, the bounds on the voltage magnitude difference variables can be significantly smaller than the bounds on the voltage magnitudes themselves, so constraints based on voltage magnitude differences can tighten the relaxation. Second, rather than a potentially weaker "nested McCormick" formulation, this paper applies "Meyer and Floudas" envelopes that yield the convex hull of the trilinear monomials formed by the product of the voltage magnitudes and trignometric terms in the polar form of the power flow equations. Comparison to a state-of-the-art QC implementation demonstrates the advantages of these improvements via smaller optimality gaps.

We apply several topological graph metrics to 33 publiclyavailable power grids. Results show that a straightforward, computationally inexpensive set of checks can quickly identify structural anomalies, especially when a broad set of test networks is available to establish norms. Another application of graph metrics is the characterization of computational behavior. We conclude by illustrating one compelling example: the close connection between clique analysis and semidefinite programming solver performance.

					The solution to an optimal power flow (OPF) problem provides a minimum cost operating point for an electric power system. The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm that is guaranteed to compute the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, "bound tightening" and "grid pruning" algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem. The proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.

					Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod	OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation’s solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of 8 time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time and solution quality.

					A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.

					Increasing communication and control capabilities will allow future power system operators to exploit large quantities of responsive demand. This paper discusses ongoing work that employs demand response to improve voltage stability via virtual spatial shifting of loads (i.e., altering the locational distribution of power consumption in one time period with an energy payback in a following time period). In this paper, we study the impact of load models on a previously proposed iterative linearization algorithm to determine loading patterns that maximize a voltage stability margin, namely, the smallest singular value (SSV) of the power flow Jacobian matrix. Specifically, we extend the algorithm to enable inclusion of composite load models consisting of both "ZIP" components and a steady-state squirrel-cage induction machine (IM) model. We then investigate the impact of different load models on both the stability margin and the loading pattern. Using the IEEE 14-bus system as an illustrative example, the results show that the  type of load model affects the nominal system's SSV, the optimal SSV, and the optimal loading pattern. The maximum-achievable percent change in SSV is larger using IM models than using ZIP models. We also discuss the difficulty in interpreting the stability margin when the system undergoes structural changes resulting from the use of different voltage-dependent load models.

					Many power system optimization problems are inherently affected by uncertainty, as it is generally impossible to exactly forecast load or renewable generation. Finding solutions that lead to low-cost, yet secure operation for a range of conditions is an important concern to system operators. This paper considers an iterative algorithm for solving power system optimization problems that include models of uncertainty and AC power flow physics. This algorithm iterates between solving deterministic nonlinear optimization problems with the AC power flow model and updating constraint tightenings that adjust the constraints to facilitate secure operation. Decoupling the uncertainty and the nonlinear optimization steps provides several advantages, such as tractability for large-scale problems and the ability to separately apply state-of-the-art techniques for handling the uncertainty and the nonlinearity. Using numerical examples and theoretical analyses, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of the iterative algorithm in solving general power system optimization problems. This paper further characterizes the behavior of the iterative algorithm with respect to convergence, optimality, and infeasibility, and suggests several modifications to improve performance.

					Electric power systems with high penetrations of fluctuating renewable generation may operate close to their stability limits. Demand response can be used to improve power system stability. For example, it is already used to provide frequency control, improving frequency stability. This paper presents a new demand response strategy that uses fast-acting flexible loads to change the loading pattern while keeping the total load constant, improving steady-state voltage stability without affecting the system frequency. The new loading pattern is maintained only for a short period of time until the generators can be re-dispatched. Our goal is to find a permissible loading pattern that maximizes the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, which serves as a measure of voltage stability. The corresponding non-convex optimization problem is solved with an iterative linear programming approach that uses eigenvalue sensitivities and a linearization of the AC power flow equations. Using two IEEE test cases as illustrative examples, we show that the loading patterns resulting from the proposed approach give smallest singular values that are very close to those obtained from a brute force search. The results are also compared to another voltage stability measure given by the maximum loading margin for uniformly varying power injections.

					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. This paper uses the example problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization and a related "mixed semidefinite/second-order cone programming" hierarchy.

				<span id="cdc2016_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under "normal" operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are "small". However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks. Our experimental results show that the bounds are reasonably tight (i.e., there are points within the domain of interest that are close to achieving the bound) over a range of operating conditions.

					The power flow equations, which relate power injections and voltage phasors, are at the heart of many electric power system computations. While Newton-based methods typically find the "high-voltage" solution to the power flow equations, which is of primary interest, there are potentially many "low-voltage" solutions that are useful for certain analyses. This paper addresses the number of solutions to the power flow equations. There exist upper bounds on the number of power flow solutions; however, there is only limited work regarding bounds that are functions of network topology. This paper empirically explores the relationship between the network topology, as characterized by the maximal cliques, and the number of power flow solutions. To facilitate this analysis, we use a numerical polynomial homotopy continuation approach that is guaranteed to find all complex solutions to the power flow equations. The number of solutions obtained from this approach upper bounds the number of real solutions. Testing with many small networks informs the development of upper bounds that are functions of the network topology. Initial results include empirically derived expressions for the maximum number of solutions for certain classes of network topologies.

					The power flow equations are at the core of most of the computations for designing and operating electric grids. This system of multivariate nonlinear equations relate the power injections and voltages in an electric power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to solve these equations, from Newton-based methods to homotopy continuation and other optimization-based methods. Although many of these methods often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution, challenges remain for finding low-voltage solutions, which play significant roles in certain stability-related computations. While we do not claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods, this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in power flow solution methods to the wider power systems community as well as bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization communities to power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the traditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we focus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, Gr&ouml;bner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using semidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an upper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review the current status of research in this direction.

					Reliable power system operation requires maintaining sufficient voltage stability margins.

Augmentation with integer-constrained variables enables consideration of reactive-power-limited generators. Further, leveraging the ability to globally solve these problems, this paper describes a sufficient condition for insolvability of the power flow equations.

					The power flow equations model the steady-state relationship between the power injections and voltage phasors in an electric power system. By separating the real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors, the power flow equations can be formulated as a system of quadratic polynomials. Only the real solutions to these polynomial equations are physically meaningful. This paper focuses on the maximum number of real solutions to the power flow equations. The literature provides upper bounds on the number of real power flow solutions based on the maximum number of complex solutions. There exist two- and three-bus systems which have as many real solutions as the upper bounds given by the maximum number of complex solutions. It is an open question whether this is also the case for larger systems. This paper uses a conjecture and recent algorithmic developments from Galois group theory to suggest a negative answer to this question. Specifically, this paper studies a generic four-bus system composed of PV buses. If a conjecture in Galois group theory holds, the maximum number of real power flow solutions for this system is upper bounded by 16, which is strictly less than 20, the maximum number of complex solutions. This paper also provides parameter values for this system which give rise to 16 real solutions, so this upper bound is achievable.

					Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in "tighter" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.

					The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes the operating cost of an electric power system. Applications of convex relaxation techniques to the non-convex OPF problem have been of recent interest, including work using the Lasserre hierarchy of "moment" relaxations to globally solve many OPF problems. By preprocessing the network model to eliminate low-impedance lines, this paper demonstrates the capability of the moment relaxations to globally solve large OPF problems that minimize active power losses for portions of several European power systems. Large problems with more general objective functions have thus far been computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment relaxations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the combination of an objective function penalization with the moment relaxations. This combination yields feasible points with objective function values that are close to the global optimum of several large OPF problems. Compared to an existing penalization method, the combination of penalization and the moment relaxations eliminates the need to specify one of the penalty parameters and solves a broader class of problems.

				<span id="naps2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Large-scale electric power system analysis depends upon representation of vast numbers of components whose individual models must be populated with parameters. The challenge of populating such component models is particularly apparent in optimal power flow applications, in which incorrect parameters and/or constraint limits can yield overall system representations with either unrealistically large feasible regions or an empty feasible set. Unfortunately, many data sets, particularly those of publicly available test cases, were originally developed to illustrate simpler "power flow only" applications, and may contain unrealistic values or wholly omit important constraint limits. This paper describes engineering-based approaches to obtain credible estimates for parameters and limits associated with line-flow constraints and generator capability curves, as may be employed in a number of steady state analyses such as the optimal power flow. These can substitute for missing or unrealistic data in test systems for which more fully detailed, "real-world" component specifications and limits are not available, and thereby make such test systems more valuable as research tools.

				<span id="powertech2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, convex "moment" relaxations developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems have been shown capable of globally solving many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The moment relaxations, which take the form of semidefinite programs (SDP), generalize a previous SDP relaxation of the OPF problem. This paper presents an approach for improving the computational performance of the moment relaxations for many problems. This approach enforces second-order cone programming (SOCP) constraints that establish necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for satisfaction of the SDP constraints arising from the higher-order moment relaxations. The resulting "mixed SDP/SOCP" formulation implements the first-order relaxation using SDP constraints and the higher-order relaxations using SOCP constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that this mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation is capable of solving many problems for which the first-order moment relaxation fails to yield a global solution. For several examples, the mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation improves computational speed by factors from 1.13 to 18.7.

				<span id="iscas2015_year" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the semidefinite relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the semidefinite relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the semidefinite relaxation can be related to  physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The semidefinite relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the semidefinite relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics.

Existing SDP formulations consider constant power components and can be easily extended to incorporate constant impedance components. With linear dependence on voltage magnitude, constant current components are not trivially formulated in a manner amenable to SDP.

						Recent applications of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem offers a polynomial time method to compute a global optimum for a large subclass of OPF problems. In contrast, prior OPF solution methods in the literature guarantee only local optimality for the solution produced. However, solvers employing SDP relaxation remain significantly slower than mature OPF solution codes. This letter seeks to combine the advantages of the two methods. In particular, we develop a SDP-inspired sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution. This test may then be easily applied to a candidate solution generated by a traditional, only-guaranteed-locally-optimal OPF solver.

						Power system planning and operation offers multitudinous opportunities for optimization methods. In practice, these problems are generally large-scale, non-linear, subject to uncertainties, and combine both continuous and discrete variables. In the recent years, a number of complementary theoretical advances in addressing such problems have been obtained in the field of applied mathematics. The paper introduces a selection of these advances in the fields of non-convex optimization, in mixed-integer programming, and in optimization under uncertainty. The practical relevance of these developments for power systems planning and operation are discussed, and the opportunities for combining them, together with high-performance computing and big data  infrastructures, as well as novel machine learning and randomized algorithms, are highlighted.

						Recently, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations has been applied to the optimal power flow problem. When this relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero duality gap), a globally optimal solution is obtained. Existing literature investigates sufficient conditions whose satisfaction guarantees zero duality gap solutions. However, there is limited study of non-zero duality gap solutions. By illustrating the feasible spaces for optimal power flow problems and their semidefinite relaxations, this paper investigates examples of nonzero duality gap solutions. Results for large system models suggest that non-convexities associated with small subsections of the network are responsible for non-zero duality gap solutions.

						The Electric Power Grid is a critical infrastructure upon which the nation relies for delivery of much of its energy use.  It supports the needs of industry, commerce, and consumer end use. Reliability and economic efficiency are essentials.  Disruptions are inconvenient and can be very costly. The research presented here is directed towards optimal use of grid resources to ensure reliability and minimize cost. The analysis and optimization needs for planning and operation of the electric power system are challenging to meet due to the scale and form of model representations. The connected network spans the continent and the mathematical models are inherently nonlinear. Traditionally, computational limits have necessitated the use of very simplified models for grid analysis, and this has resulted in either less secure operation, or less efficient operation, or both. The research conducted in this project advances techniques for power system optimization problems that will enhance reliable and efficient operation. The results of this work appear in numerous publications and address different application problems include Optimal Power Flow (OPF) [8, 9, 15, 52, 53], unit commitment [41], demand response [46, 49], reliability margins [32, 33, 38], planning [42, 47, 48], transmission expansion [50, 51], and general tools and algorithms [43, 44, 45]. Importantly, the research has been successfully transferred into the practical application domain by its inclusion in the most recent release of the widely-used MATPOWER suite of power system analysis tools.

						The application of semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem has recently attracted significant research interest. This paper provides advances in modeling and computation required for solving the OPF problem for large-scale, general power system models. Specifically, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the OPF problem is presented that incorporates multiple generators at the same bus and parallel lines. Recent research in matrix completion techniques that decompose a single large matrix constrained to be positive semidefinite into many smaller matrices has made solution of OPF problems using semidefinite programming computationally tractable for large system models. We provide three advances to existing decomposition techniques: a matrix combination algorithm that further decreases solver time, a modification to an existing decomposition technique that extends its applicability to general power system networks, and a method for obtaining the optimal voltage profile from the solution to a decomposed semidefinite program.

The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solution boundary. In practical terms, this distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins.  A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); here we additionally introduce a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages.

						Initializing internal variables in dynamic power system simulations is a two-stage process. First, a power flow model is used to find the steady state bus variables. Second, values for the internal variables associated with bus connected components are determined such that the components' terminal values match the bus variables calculated from the power flow model. Initializing most components' variables is a straightforward, direct process. However, initializing induction machine variables traditionally uses an indirect, iterative process. In this paper, eigenvalue formulations are detailed for both the induction machine initialization and power flow models, which provide a direct method for determining all possible sets of induction machine initializations and offer a novel model for the power flow equations.

						Motivated by the potential for improvements in electric power system economics and reliability, this dissertation investigates applications of a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations, which model the steady-state relationship between power injections and voltages in a power system. In contrast to other optimal power flow solution techniques, semidefinite program solvers can reliably find a global optimum in polynomial time when the semidefinite relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero relaxation gap). Semidefinite relaxations have been applied to a variety of computationally difficult problems in many fields. The power systems literature details limited success in applying semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which minimizes operating cost under engineering and network constraints. Semidefinite programming holds significant promise for application to other power systems problems.</br></br>

						This dissertation first investigates power system economics using a semidefinite relaxation of the OPF problem. In contrast to claims in the literature, this dissertation shows that the semidefinite relaxation may fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., the solution has non-zero relaxation gap) for some practical problems. This dissertation also provides computational and modeling advances required for solving large-scale, realistic OPF problems. Modeling advances include allowing multiple generators at the same bus; parallel transmission lines and transformers; and an approximate method for modeling constant impedance, constant current, constant power (ZIP) loads. Existing methods exploit system sparsity to speed computation using matrix completion techniques that decompose the large positive semidefinite matrix constraint into constraints on many smaller matrices. Computational advances include modifying the matrix decomposition techniques for further reductions in solver times, extending the applicability of an existing decomposition, and a method for obtaining an optimal voltage profile from a solution to a decomposed semidefinite program. This dissertation also provides a sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution obtained by any method.</br></br>

						This dissertation next provides techniques for improving power system reliability. The first reliability-related research develops a sufficient condition under which the power flow equations have no solution. This sufficient condition is evaluated using a feasible semidefinite optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solvability boundary. This distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins. A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); this dissertation additionally introduces a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages. This dissertation considers generators modeled as ideal voltage sources and generators with reactive power limits, which require either mixed-integer semidefinite programming or sum of squares programming formulations.</br></br>

						Also related to power system reliability is the problem of finding multiple solutions to the power flow equations. Power systems typically operate at a high-voltage, stable power flow solution; however, other solutions are used for stability calculations. Existing literature claims that a continuation-based algorithm can reliably find all power flow solutions. This claim is demonstrated to be incorrect with a small counterexample system. Thus, no computationally tractable algorithms exist for reliably finding all power flow solutions. Methods for calculating multiple power flow solutions therefore deserve further research. This dissertation describes a method for finding multiple power flow solutions using semidefinite programming. Results suggest the method's promise for identifying large numbers of power flow solutions.</br></br>

						Although the semidefinite relaxation of the power flow equations is often "tight," non-zero relaxation gap solutions can occur. This dissertation investigates examples of non-zero relaxation gap solutions to semidefinite formulations for the optimal power flow problem, for the power flow insolvability condition, and for determining multiple solutions to the power flow equations.

						Although financial transmissions rights (FTRs) are intended to allow physical participants in electricity markets to hedge the locational price risk associated with their bilateral contracts, both physical participants and speculators take part in FTR auctions. While speculators likely increase the liquidity of FTR auction markets, physical participants and ultimately ratepayers bear the cost of the profits made by speculators. Given the regulated nature of physical participants in contrast to the largely unregulated speculators, it is hypothesized that speculators in FTR auction markets are obtaining substantial profits at the expense of physical participants. This study details a statistical model for characterizing market participants in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) FTR auctions as either speculators or physical participants. Estimates of the total profit made by speculators and measures of the liquidity provided by speculators in FTR auctions are then determined. A sensitivity analysis is used to provide reasonable bounds for these estimates. The best estimates determined in this analysis show speculator profits of 152% of total market profits, equal to $283 million over three years, with speculator transactions accounting for 74% of total market transactions on a megawatt basis.

						The application of semidefinite programming (SDP) to power system problems has recently attracted substantial research interest. Specifically, a recent SDP formulation offers a convex relaxation to the well-known, typically nonconvex "optimal power flow" (OPF) problem. This new formulation was demonstrated to yield zero duality gap for several standard power systems test cases, thereby ensuring a globally optimal OPF solution in each. The first goal of the work here is to investigate this SDP algorithm for the OPF, and show by example that it can fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., it has a nonzero duality gap) in some scenarios of practical interest. The remainder of this paper investigates a SDP approach utilizing modified objective and constraints to compute all solutions of the nonlinear power flow equations. Several variants are described. Results suggest SDP's promise as an efficient algorithm for identifying large numbers of solutions to the power flow equations.

						The Electricity Modernization Act of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the creation of enforceable reliability standards for users, owners, and operators of the “Bulk-Power System” (BPS). This paper introduces an algorithm based on electrical properties of an electric power network that yields a numeric ranking of its branch elements, as a step towards identifying which elements should be considered part of the BPS. This ranking depends solely on network topology and element electrical characteristics, and is wholly independent of generator cost functions and system operating point. Two perspectives for deriving and justifying this ranking algorithm are described: one based on the sensitivity of bus-to-branch Lagrange multipliers and another based on generation shift factors. Summary results obtained from applying the algorithm to a detailed model of the US Eastern Interconnection are reported (with suitable anonymity for any facility specific data, in keeping with Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) protections).

						Eigenvalue problems incorporate multiplicative nonlinearities in otherwise linear equations. Two power systems problems with multiplicative nonlinearities are reformulated as eigenvalue problems. Reformulation allows for the application of eigenvalue theory and solution techniques to these problems.</br></br>

						The first problem involves determination of the initial conditions for induction machine internal variables in a non-linear dynamic power system analysis. The internal variables of stator and rotor currents, rotor speed, and mechanical torque must be determined from the given values of input real power, stator voltage magnitude, and stator voltage angle. This problem is posed in an eigenvalue formulation that can be solved using standard linear algebra techniques. The eigenvalue formulation allows for determination of all possible solutions for the internal variables rather than the single solution obtained from traditional iterative methods. Additionally, the absence of non-zero real eigenvalues indicates that the problem has no solution. Both single-cage and double-cage induction machine models are considered, and numeric examples are presented.</br></br>

						The second problem involves reformulation of the power flow equations as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem. In this formulation, both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are composed of the d and q orthogonal components of the bus voltages. The two parameter formulation of the power flow equations for two bus systems can be solved directly by decomposing the problem into two generalized eigenvalue problems that must be simultaneously satisfied. Since n bus systems require 2(n-1) parameter eigenvalue problems, which do not yet have a general solution method for n > 2, systems with more than two buses are not yet directly solvable from the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation.</br></br>

						In addition to direct solution, two other research avenues for the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations are pursued. First, motivated by eigenvalue problem structure, a reformulation of the multiparameter eigenvalue form of the power flow equations is presented. Although it is without known practical applications, this reformulation and the intermediate results in its derivation are interesting from a theoretical standpoint. Second, an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is performed on the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations. The linearization obtained from the eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is equivalent to the linearization obtained from the power flow Jacobian.</br></br>

						Future developments in multiparameter eigenvalue theory may provide additional insights into solutions of the power flow equations. General solution techniques for multiparameter eigenvalue problems with more than two parameters may enable direct solution of the power flow equations. A method for determining the number of solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful as a stopping condition for continuation power flows. Conditions for the existence of any solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful for finding the point of voltage collapse and for analyzing power systems in heavily loaded conditions.

This paper focuses on the key characteristic of <i>invertibility</i>. Previous literature has presented an invertibility condition for admittance matrices. This paper first identifies and fixes a technical issue in the proof of this previously presented invertibility condition. This paper then extends this previous work by deriving new conditions that are applicable to a broader class of systems with lossless branches and transformers with off-nominal tap ratios.

				<span id="robustACOPFconvexrestriction_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Electric power grids regularly experience uncertain fluctuations from load demands and renewables, which poses a risk of violating operational limits designed to safeguard the system. In this paper, we consider the robust AC OPF problem that minimizes the generation cost while requiring a certain level of system security in the presence of uncertainty. The robust AC OPF problem requires that the system satisfy operational limits for all uncertainty realizations within a specified uncertainty set. Guaranteeing robustness is particularly challenging due to the non-convex, nonlinear AC power flow equations, which may not always have a solution. In this work, we extend a previously developed convex restriction to a <i>robust convex restriction</i>, which is a convex inner approximation of the non-convex feasible region of the AC OPF problem that accounts for uncertainty in the power injections. We then use the robust convex restriction in an algorithm that obtains robust solutions to AC OPF problems by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. We demonstrate our algorithm and its ability to control robustness versus operating cost trade-offs using PGLib test cases.

				<span id="robust_dc_network_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					With high penetrations of renewable generation and variable loads, there is significant uncertainty associated with power flows in DC networks such that stability and constraint satisfaction are important concerns. Most existing DC network optimal power flow (DN-OPF) formulations assume exact knowledge about loading conditions and do not provide stability guarantees. In contrast, this paper studies a DN-OPF formulation which considers both stability and constraint satisfaction under uncertainty. The need to account for a range of uncertainty realizations in this paper’s robust optimization formulation results in a challenging semi-infinite program (SIP). The proposed solution algorithm reformulates this SIP into a computationally amenable problem whose solution provides a feasible operating point for the SIP. This algorithm constructs a convex stability set using sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible and stable power flow solution. Solving an optimization problem based on this convex stability set provides generator set points which ensure that the DC network has a stable operating point for any considered uncertainty realization. This optimization problem takes a form similar to a deterministic DN-OPF problem and is therefore tractable. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated using various DC networks adapted from IEEE test cases.

				<span id="covidload_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					To mitigate the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), governments around the world have imposed social distancing policies ranging from minor social activity suspensions to full curfews. These social distancing policies have altered electricity consumption behaviors in numerous countries. This paper studies how strict social distancing policies affect the relationship between electricity demand and ambient temperature. This relationship is especially important since most governments imposed strict social distancing policies during a temperature transition season where the impacts of temperature variations are particularly important for grid operations. In this paper, we first review the expected short- and long-term impacts of social distancing on the electricity demand. We then present a case study on the electricity demand of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during strict social distancing policies. The results of this case study suggest that strict social distancing policies result in a stronger dependency between temperature and electricity demand. Additionally, we observe a reduction in the time required for the electricity demand to respond to temperature changes. Power system regulators can use the results in this paper to better design energy policies and cope with rare events. Additionally, power system operators can use the results in this paper to more accurately forecast electricity demands to avoid inefficient and insecure operation of the electric grid.

					Optimal power flow (OPF) is a key problem in power system operations. OPF problems that use the nonlinear AC power flow equations to accurately model the network physics have inherent challenges associated with non-convexity. To address these challenges, recent research has applied various convex relaxation approaches to OPF problems. The QC relaxation is a promising approach that convexifies the trigonometric and product terms in the OPF problem by enclosing these terms in convex envelopes. The accuracy of the QC relaxation strongly depends on the tightness of these envelopes. This paper presents two improvements to these envelopes. The first improvement leverages a polar representation of the branch admittances in addition to the rectangular representation used previously. The second improvement is based on a coordinate transformation via a complex per unit base power normalization that rotates the power flow equations. The trigonometric envelopes resulting from this rotation can be tighter than the corresponding envelopes in previous QC relaxation formulations. Using an empirical analysis with a variety of test cases, this paper suggests an appropriate value for the angle of the complex base power. Comparing the results with a state-of-the-art QC formulation reveals the advantages of the proposed improvements.

					Managing uncertainty and variability in power injections has become a major concern for power system operators due to increasing levels of fluctuating renewable energy connected to the grid. This work addresses this uncertainty via a joint chance-constrained formulation of the DC optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which satisfies <i>all</i> the constraints <i>jointly</i> with a pre-determined probability. The few existing approaches for solving joint chance-constrained OPF problems are typically either computationally intractable for large-scale problems or give overly conservative solutions that satisfy the constraints far more often than required, resulting in excessively costly operation. This paper proposes an algorithm for solving joint chance-constrained DC OPF problems by adopting an S&#8467;<sub>1</sub>QP-type trust-region algorithm. This algorithm uses a sample-based approach that avoids making strong assumptions on the distribution of the uncertainties, scales favorably to large problems, and can be tuned to obtain less conservative results. We illustrate the performance of our method using several IEEE test cases. The results demonstrate the proposed algorithm's advantages in computational times and limited conservativeness of the solutions relative to other joint chance-constrained DC OPF algorithms.

					Advances in data-driven methods have sparked renewed interest for applications in power systems. Creating datasets for successful application of these methods has proven to be very challenging, especially when considering power system security. This paper proposes a computationally efficient method to create datasets of secure and insecure operating points. We propose an infeasibility certificate based on separating hyperplanes that can a-priori characterize large parts of the input space as insecure, thus significantly reducing both computation time and problem size. Our method can handle an order of magnitude more control variables and creates balanced datasets of secure and insecure operating points, which is essential for data-driven applications. While we focus on N-1 security and uncertainty, our method can extend to dynamic security. For PGLib-OPF networks up to 500 buses and up to 125 control variables, we demonstrate drastic reductions in unclassified input space volumes and computation time, create balanced datasets, and evaluate an illustrative data-driven application.

					In distribution systems, power injection variability due to growing penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) and dispatchable loads can lead to power quality issues such as severe voltage unbalance. To ensure safe operation of	phase-balance-sensitive components such as transformers and	induction motor loads, the amount of voltage unbalance must be maintained within specified limits for a range of uncertain loading conditions. This paper builds on existing "solvability conditions" that characterize operating regions for which the power flow equations are guaranteed to have a unique high-voltage solution.	We extend these existing solvability conditions to be applicable to distribution systems and augment them with a “balancibility” condition which quantifies an operating region within which a unique, adequately balanced power flow solution exists. To	build this condition, we consider different unbalance definitions	and derive closed-form representations through reformulations or	safe approximations. Using case studies, we evaluate these closed-form representations and compare the balancibility conditions	associated with different unbalance definitions.

					Convex relaxations of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems have attracted significant interest as in several instances they provably yield the global optimum to the original non-convex problem. If, however, the relaxation is inexact, the obtained solution is not AC-feasible. The quality of the obtained solution is essential for several practical applications of AC-OPF, but detailed analyses are lacking in existing literature. This paper aims to cover this gap. We provide an in-depth investigation of the solution characteristics when convex relaxations are inexact, we assess the most promising AC feasibility recovery methods for large-scale systems, and we propose two new metrics that lead to a better understanding of the quality of the identified solutions. We perform a comprehensive assessment on 96 different test cases, ranging from 14 to 3120 buses, and we show the following: (i) Despite an optimality gap of less than 1%, several test cases still exhibit substantial distances to both AC feasibility and local optimality and the newly proposed metrics characterize these deviations. (ii) Penalization methods fail to recover an AC-feasible solution in 15 out of 45 test cases. (iii) The computational benefits of warm-starting non-convex solvers have significant variation, but a computational speedup exists in over 75% of the test cases.

						Nonconvexity induced by the nonlinear AC power flow equations challenges solution algorithms for AC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. While significant research efforts have focused on reliably computing high-quality OPF solutions, it is not always clear that there exists a feasible path to reach the desired operating point. Transitioning between operating points while avoiding constraint violations can be challenging since the feasible space of the OPF problem is nonconvex and potentially disconnected. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm that computes a provably feasible path from an initial operating point to a desired operating point. Given an initial feasible point, the algorithm solves a sequence of convex quadratically constrained optimization problems over conservative convex inner approximations of the OPF feasible space. In each iteration, we obtain a new, improved operating point and a feasible transition from the operating point in the previous iteration. In addition to computing a feasible path to a known desired operating point, this algorithm can also be used to improve the operating point locally. Extensive numerical studies on a variety of test cases demonstrate the algorithm and the ability to arrive at a high-quality solution in few iterations.

				<span id="SDP_plus_local_solution_for_OPF_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Optimal power flow (OPF) is an important problem in the operation of electric power systems. Due to the OPF problem's non-convexity, there may exist multiple local optima. Certifiably obtaining the global solution is important for certain applications of OPF problems. Many global optimization techniques compute an optimality gap that compares the achievable objective value corresponding to the feasible point from a local solution algorithm with the objective value bound from a convex relaxation technique. Rather than the traditional practice of completely separating the local solution and convex relaxation computations, this paper proposes a method that exploits information from a local solution to speed the computation of an objective value bound using a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The improvement in computational tractability comes with the trade-off of reduced tightness for the resulting objective value bound. Numerical experiments illustrate this trade-off, with the proposed method being faster but weaker than the SDP relaxation and slower but tighter than second-order cone programming (SOCP) and quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for many large test cases.

					The increasing penetration of renewables has driven power systems to operate closer to their stability boundaries, increasing the risk of instability. We propose a multiperiod optimal power flow approach that uses demand responsive loads to improve steady-state voltage stability, which is measured by the smallest singular value (SSV) of the power flow Jacobian matrix. In contrast to past work that employs load shedding to improve stability, our approach improves the SSV by decreasing and increasing individual loads while keeping the total loading constant to avoid fluctuation of the system frequency. Additionally, an energy payback period maintains the total energy consumption of each load at its nominal value. The objective function balances SSV improvements against generation costs in the energy payback period. We develop an iterative linear programming algorithm using singular value sensitivities to obtain an AC-feasible solution. We demonstrate its performance on two IEEE test systems. The results show that demand response actions can improve static voltage stability, in some cases more cost-effectively than generation actions. We also compare our algorithm's performance to that of an iterative nonlinear programming algorithm from the literature. We find that our approach is approximately 6 times faster when applied to the IEEE 9-bus system, allowing us to demonstrate its performance on the IEEE 118-bus system.

This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting and characterizing cyberattacks to network parameter data, with specific application to optimal power flow problems.

					Optimal power flow (OPF) is an important problem in the operation of electric power systems. The solution to an OPF problem provides a minimum cost operating point that satisfies constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies and characterizes non-convexities in OPF feasible spaces. This algorithm searches for a pair of feasible points whose connecting line segment contains an infeasible point. Such points certify the existence of a non-convexity in the OPF feasible space. Moreover, the constraint violations at the infeasible point along the connecting line segment physically characterize a cause of the non-convexity. Numerical demonstrations include a small illustrative example as well as applications to various test cases.

					We propose general notions to deal with large scale polynomial optimization problems and demonstrate their efficiency on a key industrial problem of the twenty first century, namely the optimal power flow problem. These notions enable us to find global minimizers on instances with up to 4,500 variables and 14,500 constraints. First, we generalize the Lasserre hierarchy from real to complex to numbers in order to enhance its tractability when dealing with complex polynomial optimization. Complex numbers are typically used to represent oscillatory phenomena, which are omnipresent in physical systems. Using the notion of hyponormality in operator theory, we provide a finite convergence criterion which generalizes the Curto-Fialkow conditions of the real Lasserre hierarchy. Second, we introduce the multi-ordered Lasserre hierarchy in order to exploit sparsity in polynomial optimization problems (in real or complex variables) while preserving global convergence. It is based on two ideas: 1) to use a different relaxation order for each constraint, and 2) to iteratively seek a closest measure to the truncated moment data until a measure matches the truncated data. Third and last, we exhibit a block diagonal structure of the Lasserre hierarchy in the presence of commonly encountered symmetries.

					Many power system optimization problems constrain line flows with limits specified in terms of the magnitudes of apparent power or current flows. The set of line-flow constraints may have redundancies (i.e., the feasible space may be unchanged upon removal of a subset of the line-flow constraints), which unnecessarily complicate optimization problems. This letter describes an algorithm for identifying redundant line-flow constraints corresponding to certain parallel lines. After formulating the constraints as ellipsoids in the voltage variables, redundancies are detected from the absence of intersections between pairs of ellipsoids corresponding to parallel lines.

					The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, n, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of n. For these, the equilibria can be located by finding the real solutions of a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. However, typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions give equilibria.

					In this paper, we present an algorithm to locate only the real solutions of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. The correctness of the algorithm (that it finds only and all the equilibria) is proved rigorously. Additionally, the algorithm can be implemented using interval methods so that the equilibria can be approximated up to any given precision without significantly more computational effort. We also compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods.

					Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.

The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem's feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm that is guaranteed to compute the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem's inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, "bound tightening" and "grid pruning" algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem.

					Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod	OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation’s solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of 8 time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time and solution quality.

					A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only provides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal decision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing portions of European power systems.

					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. This paper uses the example problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization and a related "mixed semidefinite/second-order cone programming" hierarchy.

					Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in "tighter" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.

This paper provides advances in modeling and computation required for solving the OPF problem for large-scale, general power system models. Specifically, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the OPF problem is presented that incorporates multiple generators at the same bus and parallel lines. Recent research in matrix completion techniques that decompose a single large matrix constrained to be positive semidefinite into many smaller matrices has made solution of OPF problems using semidefinite programming computationally tractable for large system models. We provide three advances to existing decomposition techniques: a matrix combination algorithm that further decreases solver time, a modification to an existing decomposition technique that extends its applicability to general power system networks, and a method for obtaining the optimal voltage profile from the solution to a decomposed semidefinite program.

					For the nonlinear power flow problem specified with standard PQ, PV, and slack bus equality constraints, we present a sufficient condition under which the specified set of nonlinear algebraic equations has no solution. This sufficient condition is constructed in a framework of an associated feasible, convex optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solution boundary. In practical terms, this distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins.  A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); here we additionally introduce a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages.

					Initializing internal variables in dynamic power system simulations is a two-stage process. First, a power flow model is used to find the steady state bus variables. Second, values for the internal variables associated with bus connected components are determined such that the components' terminal values match the bus variables calculated from the power flow model. Initializing most components' variables is a straightforward, direct process. However, initializing induction machine variables traditionally uses an indirect, iterative process. In this paper, eigenvalue formulations are detailed for both the induction machine initialization and power flow models, which provide a direct method for determining all possible sets of induction machine initializations and offer a novel model for the power flow equations.

					Although financial transmissions rights (FTRs) are intended to allow physical participants in electricity markets to hedge the locational price risk associated with their bilateral contracts, both physical participants and speculators take part in FTR auctions. While speculators likely increase the liquidity of FTR auction markets, physical participants and ultimately ratepayers bear the cost of the profits made by speculators. Given the regulated nature of physical participants in contrast to the largely unregulated speculators, it is hypothesized that speculators in FTR auction markets are obtaining substantial profits at the expense of physical participants. This study details a statistical model for characterizing market participants in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) FTR auctions as either speculators or physical participants. Estimates of the total profit made by speculators and measures of the liquidity provided by speculators in FTR auctions are then determined. A sensitivity analysis is used to provide reasonable bounds for these estimates. The best estimates determined in this analysis show speculator profits of 152% of total market profits, equal to $283 million over three years, with speculator transactions accounting for 74% of total market transactions on a megawatt basis.

				We propose an approach for verifying that a given feasible point for a polynomial optimization problem is globally optimal. The approach relies on the Lasserre hierarchy and the result of Lasserre regarding the importance of the convexity of the feasible set as opposed to that of the individual constraints. By focusing solely on certifying global optimality and relaxing the Lasserre hierarchy using necessary conditions for positive semidefiniteness based on matrix determinants, the proposed method is implementable as a computationally tractable linear program. We demonstrate this method via application to the optimal power flow problem used to operate electric power systems.

				<span id="fdpf_rotated_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The Fast Decoupled Power Flow (FDPF) method has been widely adopted due to its computational speed advantages relative to the Newton-Raphson method for many practically relevant power flow problems. The FDPF method relies on the assumption that the lines are highly inductive, i.e., have small R/X ratios. When this assumption does not hold (e.g., for distribution systems and some subtransmission systems), the FDPF method may exhibit slow convergence or fail to converge entirely. To address such cases, previous work has proposed an <i>axis rotation</i> method which rescales the complex power injections and the bus admittances by a unit-magnitude complex scalar parameter. Since this complex parameter adjusts the lines' R/X ratios, an appropriate choice for this parameter can improve the FDPF method's performance. In contrast to previous work that only introduces one complex parameter for the entire system (or one complex parameter per large subsystem), we propose and analyze an axis rotation method that introduces different complex parameters at each bus. The additional degrees of freedom provided in this more granular approach are particularly valuable for systems where the lines have wider ranges of R/X ratios. To obtain appropriate values for the complex parameters, we propose to minimize the sum of the squared errors associated with the FDPF approximations. This method can also be adapted for cases with large voltage angle differences. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

					Distributed algorithms provide attractive features for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in interconnected power systems compared to traditional centralized algorithms. Distributed algorithms help to maintain the control autonomy and data privacy of subsystems, which is particularly relevant in competitive markets and practical control system implementations. This paper analyzes a distributed optimization algorithm known as the "Auxiliary Principle Problem" to solve multiperiod distributed DCOPF problems with energy storage systems. The proposed approach enables multiple interconnected systems with their own sub-objectives to share their resources and to participate in an electricity market without implicitly sharing information about their local generators or internal network parameters. The paper also shows how the proposed approach can enable future microgrids to coordinate their operation, reduce the total operational cost, and avoid internal constraint violations caused by unscheduled flows (USF) while maintaining the subsystems’ autonomy. We used an 11-bus test system consisting of two interconnected subsystems to evaluate the proposed approach and analyze the impact of USF.

				<span id="6320_active_constraints_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Efficiently and reliably operating electric power grids requires the frequent solution of optimization problems such as the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC OPF) problem. Solution of DC OPF problems can be challenging due to the large number of operational constraints imposed in these problems, especially limits on the line flows. Improving solver times can be facilitated by a better understanding of the active line flow constraints in DC OPF problems (i.e., the inequality constraints limiting line flows that are satisfied with equality at the solution). Considering a variety of test cases and a range of loading scenarios, this paper empirically characterizes the sets of active line flow constraints in DC OPF problems. Among other analyses, the paper compares the sets of redundant line flow constraints (i.e., constraints guaranteed to be inactive) that are identified by previously proposed constraint screening methods to the line flow constraints that are actually observed to be active over a range of scenarios. The results indicate that a large fraction of the line flow constraints which are not identified as being redundant by these screening methods are nevertheless inactive in the DC OPF solutions. This observation suggests the potential for improvements to the constraint screening methods. Laying the groundwork for achieving these improvements, this paper also identifies which line characteristics tend to be associated with active flow constraints and studies the relationships among sets of simultaneously active line flow constraints.

				<span id="unbalance_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Growing penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) increase the power injection variability in distribution systems, which can result in power quality issues such as voltage unbalance. To measure unbalance, organizations such as IEC, NEMA and IEEE define phase unbalance in their power quality standards. However, the definitions in these different standards are not consistent, and voltages that are considered acceptable by one standard may violate good practices defined by another standard. To address this issue, this paper provides analytical comparisons of the most common voltage unbalance definitions, which are supplemented with numerical simulations. The analytical relationships suggest that it is possible to approximately bound the symmetrical-component-based voltage unbalance factor (which depends on the magnitude and relative phase angle) by limiting the line-to-line voltage unbalance, whereas applying line-to-ground voltage unbalance definitions neglects all information about phase angle offsets.

				<span id="redundant2019_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					In many power system optimization problems, we observe that only a small fraction of the line flow constraints ever become active at the optimal solution, despite variations in the load profile and generation costs. This observation has far-reaching implications not only for power system optimization, but also for the practical long-term planning, operation, and control of the system. We formalize this empirical observation for problems involving the DC power flow equations. We use a two-step constraint screening approach to identify constraints whose satisfaction is implied by other constraints in the problem. These constraints are redundant and can therefore can be eliminated from the problem. For the first screening step, we derive analytical bounds that quickly identify redundancies in the flow limits on parallel lines. The second screening step uses optimization-based constraint tightening, where we solve a (relaxed) optimization problem for each constraint to identify redundancies. We specifically focus our approach on large ranges of load variation such that the results are valid for long periods of time, thus justifying the computational overhead required for the screening method. Numerical results for a wide variety of standard test cases show that even with load variations up to &plusmn;100% of nominal loading, we are able to eliminate a significant fraction of the flow constraints. This large reduction in constraints may enable a range of possible applications. As one illustrative example, we demonstrate the computational improvements for the unit commitment problem obtained as a result of the reduced number of constraints.

				<span id="powertech2019_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The nonlinearity of the power flow equations leads to algorithmic and theoretical challenges for a wide variety of optimization and control problems relevant to electric power systems. Solution algorithms for these problems often use linearization techniques to obtain more tractable power flow formulations. Many existing linearizations lack specialization to a given system and operating range of interest, leading to unnecessarily large linearization errors. In contrast, recently proposed "optimal adaptive" linearizations are 1) tailored to specific systems and operating ranges of interest and 2) optimal in the sense that they minimize a selected error metric relative to the nonlinear power flow equations. Previous work proposes optimal adaptive linearizations that minimize the <i>worst-case</i> linearization error. Building on previous work, this paper uses an uncertainty quantifiation method called Polynomial Chaos Expansion to minimize the <i>expected</i> linearization error for a given probability distribution of the power injections. As validated using Monte Carlo analyses, the capabilities of the expected-error-minimizing linearizations are shown to be superior to first-order Taylor approximations computed at a nominal operating point.

				<span id="isgt2019_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					We propose the application of occupation measure theory to the classical problem of transient stability analysis for power systems. This enables the computation of certified inner and outer approximations for the region of attraction of a nominal operating point. In order to determine whether a post-disturbance point requires corrective actions to ensure stability, one would then simply need to check the sign of a polynomial evaluated at that point. Thus, computationally expensive dynamical simulations are only required for post-disturbance points in the region between the inner and outer approximations. We focus on the nonlinear swing equations but voltage dynamics could also be included. The proposed approach is formulated as a hierarchy of semidefinite programs stemming from an infinite-dimensional linear program in a measure space, with a natural dual sum-of-squares perspective. On the theoretical side, this paper lays the groundwork for exploiting the oscillatory structure of power systems by using Hermitian (instead of real) sums-of-squares and connects the proposed approach to recent results from algebraic geometry.

					Growing penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems have motivated the design of controllers that leverage DER capabilities to achieve system-wide objectives. These controllers may be either <i>grid-agnostic</i> or <i>grid-aware</i>, depending on whether distribution network constraints are considered. Grid-agnostic controllers have the benefit of not requiring network models or system measurements, but may cause dangerous constraint violations. Rather than develop a specific controller, this paper considers the <i>potential impacts</i> of DER controllers with respect to network constraint violations. Specifically, this paper develops an optimization-based method to rigorously certify when any grid-agnostic controller can be applied without concern regarding network constraint violations, or, conversely, when grid-aware control may be needed to maintain distribution grid security. The proposed method uses convex optimization techniques to bound the impacts of load variability, given a subset of buses with voltage measurements and control. The method either provides a certificate for secure operation or identifies potentially critical constraints and the need for additional controllability. Numerical tests illustrate the ability to certify secure operation for different ranges of variability.

					Solutions to optimal power flow (OPF) problems provide operating points for electric power systems that minimize operational costs while satisfying both engineering limits and the power flow equations. OPF problems are non-convex and may have multiple local optima. To search for global optima, recent research has developed a variety of convex relaxations to bound the optimal objective values of OPF problems. Certain relaxations, such as the quadratic convex (QC) relaxation, are derived from OPF representations that contain trilinear monomials. Previous work has considered three techniques for relaxing these trilinear monomials: <i>recursive McCormick</i> (RMC) envelopes, <i>Meyer and Floudas</i> (MF) envelopes, and <i>extreme-point</i> (EP) envelopes. This paper compares the tightness and computational speed of relaxations that employ each of these techniques. Forming the convex hull of a single trilinear monomial, MF and EP envelopes are equivalently tight. Empirical results show that QC formulations using MF and EP envelopes give tighter bounds than those using RMC envelopes. Empirical results also indicate that the EP envelopes have advantages over MF envelopes with respect to computational speed and numerical stability when used with state-of-the-art second-order cone programming solvers.

					Optimal power flow (OPF) is a central problem in the operation of electric power systems. An OPF problem optimizes a specified objective function subject to constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. Despite these non-convexities, local solution algorithms actually find the global optima of some practical OPF problems. This suggests that OPF problems have a range of difficulty: some problems appear to have convex or "nearly convex" feasible spaces in terms of the voltage magnitudes and power injections, while other problems can exhibit significant non-convexities. Understanding this range of problem difficulty is helpful for creating new test cases for algorithmic benchmarking purposes. Leveraging recently developed computational tools for exploring OPF feasible spaces, this paper first describes an empirical study that aims to characterize non-convexities for small OPF problems. This paper then proposes and analyzes several medium-size test cases that challenge a variety of solution algorithms.

					With growing penetrations of stochastic renewable generation and the need to accurately model the network physics, optimization problems that explicitly consider uncertainty and the AC power flow equations are becoming increasingly important to the operation of electric power systems. This paper describes initial steps towards an AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) algorithm which yields an operating point that is guaranteed to be robust to all realizations of stochastic generation within a specified uncertainty set. Ensuring robust feasibility requires overcoming two challenges: 1) ensuring solvability of the power flow equations for all uncertainty realizations and 2) guaranteeing feasibility of the engineering constraints for all uncertainty realizations. This paper primarily focuses on the latter challenge. Specifically, this paper poses the robust AC OPF problem as a bi-level program that maximizes (or minimizes) the constraint values over the uncertainty set, where a convex relaxation of the AC power flow constraints is used to ensure conservativeness. The resulting optimization program is solved using an alternating solution algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated via detailed analyses of two small test cases.

					The power flow equations are at the heart of many optimization and control problems relevant to power systems. The non-linearity of these equations leads to computational challenges in solving power flow and optimal power flow problems (non-convergence, local optima, etc.). Accordingly, various linearization techniques, such as the DC power flow, are often used to approximate the power flow equations. In contrast to a wide variety of general linearization techniques in the power systems literature, this paper computes a linear approximation that is specific to a given power system and operating range of interest. An "adaptive linearization" developed using this approach minimizes the worst-case error between the output of the approximation and the actual non-linear power flow equations over the operating range of interest. To compute an adaptive linearization, this paper proposes a constraint generation algorithm that iterates between 1) using an optimization algorithm to identify a point that maximizes the error of the linearization at that iteration and 2) updating the linearization to minimize the worst-case error among all points identified thus far. This approach is tested on several IEEE test cases, with the results demonstrating up to a factor of four improvement in approximation error over linearizations based on a first-order Taylor approximation.

					AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) is a challenging non-convex optimization problem that plays a crucial role in power system operation and control. Recently developed convex relaxation techniques provide new insights regarding the global optimality of AC OPF solutions. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is one promising approach that constructs convex envelopes around the trigonometric and product terms in the polar representation of the power flow equations. This paper proposes two methods for tightening the QC relaxation. The first method introduces new variables that represent the voltage magnitude differences between connected buses. Using "bound tightening" techniques, the bounds on the voltage magnitude difference variables can be significantly smaller than the bounds on the voltage magnitudes themselves, so constraints based on voltage magnitude differences can tighten the relaxation. Second, rather than a potentially weaker "nested McCormick" formulation, this paper applies "Meyer and Floudas" envelopes that yield the convex hull of the trilinear monomials formed by the product of the voltage magnitudes and trignometric terms in the polar form of the power flow equations. Comparison to a state-of-the-art QC implementation demonstrates the advantages of these improvements via smaller optimality gaps.

We apply several topological graph metrics to 33 publiclyavailable power grids. Results show that a straightforward, computationally inexpensive set of checks can quickly identify structural anomalies, especially when a broad set of test networks is available to establish norms. Another application of graph metrics is the characterization of computational behavior. We conclude by illustrating one compelling example: the close connection between clique analysis and semidefinite programming solver performance.

				<span id="allerton2017_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Increasing communication and control capabilities will allow future power system operators to exploit large quantities of responsive demand. This paper discusses ongoing work that employs demand response to improve voltage stability via virtual spatial shifting of loads (i.e., altering the locational distribution of power consumption in one time period with an energy payback in a following time period). In this paper, we study the impact of load models on a previously proposed iterative linearization algorithm to determine loading patterns that maximize a voltage stability margin, namely, the smallest singular value (SSV) of the power flow Jacobian matrix. Specifically, we extend the algorithm to enable inclusion of composite load models consisting of both "ZIP" components and a steady-state squirrel-cage induction machine (IM) model. We then investigate the impact of different load models on both the stability margin and the loading pattern. Using the IEEE 14-bus system as an illustrative example, the results show that the  type of load model affects the nominal system's SSV, the optimal SSV, and the optimal loading pattern. The maximum-achievable percent change in SSV is larger using IM models than using ZIP models. We also discuss the difficulty in interpreting the stability margin when the system undergoes structural changes resulting from the use of different voltage-dependent load models.

					Many power system optimization problems are inherently affected by uncertainty, as it is generally impossible to exactly forecast load or renewable generation. Finding solutions that lead to low-cost, yet secure operation for a range of conditions is an important concern to system operators. This paper considers an iterative algorithm for solving power system optimization problems that include models of uncertainty and AC power flow physics. This algorithm iterates between solving deterministic nonlinear optimization problems with the AC power flow model and updating constraint tightenings that adjust the constraints to facilitate secure operation. Decoupling the uncertainty and the nonlinear optimization steps provides several advantages, such as tractability for large-scale problems and the ability to separately apply state-of-the-art techniques for handling the uncertainty and the nonlinearity. Using numerical examples and theoretical analyses, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of the iterative algorithm in solving general power system optimization problems. This paper further characterizes the behavior of the iterative algorithm with respect to convergence, optimality, and infeasibility, and suggests several modifications to improve performance.

					Electric power systems with high penetrations of fluctuating renewable generation may operate close to their stability limits. Demand response can be used to improve power system stability. For example, it is already used to provide frequency control, improving frequency stability. This paper presents a new demand response strategy that uses fast-acting flexible loads to change the loading pattern while keeping the total load constant, improving steady-state voltage stability without affecting the system frequency. The new loading pattern is maintained only for a short period of time until the generators can be re-dispatched. Our goal is to find a permissible loading pattern that maximizes the smallest singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix, which serves as a measure of voltage stability. The corresponding non-convex optimization problem is solved with an iterative linear programming approach that uses eigenvalue sensitivities and a linearization of the AC power flow equations. Using two IEEE test cases as illustrative examples, we show that the loading patterns resulting from the proposed approach give smallest singular values that are very close to those obtained from a brute force search. The results are also compared to another voltage stability measure given by the maximum loading margin for uniformly varying power injections.

				<span id="cdc2016_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under "normal" operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are "small". However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks. Our experimental results show that the bounds are reasonably tight (i.e., there are points within the domain of interest that are close to achieving the bound) over a range of operating conditions.

					The power flow equations, which relate power injections and voltage phasors, are at the heart of many electric power system computations. While Newton-based methods typically find the "high-voltage" solution to the power flow equations, which is of primary interest, there are potentially many "low-voltage" solutions that are useful for certain analyses. This paper addresses the number of solutions to the power flow equations. There exist upper bounds on the number of power flow solutions; however, there is only limited work regarding bounds that are functions of network topology. This paper empirically explores the relationship between the network topology, as characterized by the maximal cliques, and the number of power flow solutions. To facilitate this analysis, we use a numerical polynomial homotopy continuation approach that is guaranteed to find all complex solutions to the power flow equations. The number of solutions obtained from this approach upper bounds the number of real solutions. Testing with many small networks informs the development of upper bounds that are functions of the network topology. Initial results include empirically derived expressions for the maximum number of solutions for certain classes of network topologies.

					The power flow equations are at the core of most of the computations for designing and operating electric grids. This system of multivariate nonlinear equations relate the power injections and voltages in an electric power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to solve these equations, from Newton-based methods to homotopy continuation and other optimization-based methods. Although many of these methods often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution, challenges remain for finding low-voltage solutions, which play significant roles in certain stability-related computations. While we do not claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods, this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in power flow solution methods to the wider power systems community as well as bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization communities to power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the traditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we focus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, Gr&ouml;bner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using semidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an upper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review the current status of research in this direction.

					With the potential to find global solutions, significant research interest has focused on convex relaxations of the non-convex OPF problem. Recently, "moment-based" relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization have been shown capable of globally solving a broad class of OPF problems. Global solution of many large-scale test cases is accomplished by exploiting sparsity and selectively applying the computationally intensive higher-order relaxation constraints. Previous work describes an iterative algorithm that indicates the buses for which the higher-order constraints should be enforced. In order to speed computation of the moment relaxations, this paper provides a study of the key parameter in this algorithm as applied to relaxations from both the original Lasserre hierarchy and a recent complex extension of the Lasserre hierarchy.

					Reliable power system operation requires maintaining sufficient voltage stability margins. Traditional techniques based on continuation and optimization calculate lower bounds for these margins and generally require appropriate initialization. Building on a previous semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation, this paper proposes a new second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation which directly yields upper bounds for the voltage stability margin without needing to specify an initialization. Augmentation with integer-constrained variables enables consideration of reactive-power-limited generators. Further, leveraging the ability to globally solve these problems, this paper describes a sufficient condition for insolvability of the power flow equations. Trade-offs between tightness and computational speed of the SDP and SOCP relaxations are studied using large test cases representing portions of European power systems.

					The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes the operating cost of an electric power system. Applications of convex relaxation techniques to the non-convex OPF problem have been of recent interest, including work using the Lasserre hierarchy of "moment" relaxations to globally solve many OPF problems. By preprocessing the network model to eliminate low-impedance lines, this paper demonstrates the capability of the moment relaxations to globally solve large OPF problems that minimize active power losses for portions of several European power systems. Large problems with more general objective functions have thus far been computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment relaxations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the combination of an objective function penalization with the moment relaxations. This combination yields feasible points with objective function values that are close to the global optimum of several large OPF problems. Compared to an existing penalization method, the combination of penalization and the moment relaxations eliminates the need to specify one of the penalty parameters and solves a broader class of problems.

				<span id="naps2015_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Large-scale electric power system analysis depends upon representation of vast numbers of components whose individual models must be populated with parameters. The challenge of populating such component models is particularly apparent in optimal power flow applications, in which incorrect parameters and/or constraint limits can yield overall system representations with either unrealistically large feasible regions or an empty feasible set. Unfortunately, many data sets, particularly those of publicly available test cases, were originally developed to illustrate simpler "power flow only" applications, and may contain unrealistic values or wholly omit important constraint limits. This paper describes engineering-based approaches to obtain credible estimates for parameters and limits associated with line-flow constraints and generator capability curves, as may be employed in a number of steady state analyses such as the optimal power flow. These can substitute for missing or unrealistic data in test systems for which more fully detailed, "real-world" component specifications and limits are not available, and thereby make such test systems more valuable as research tools.

					Recently, convex "moment" relaxations developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems have been shown capable of globally solving many optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The moment relaxations, which take the form of semidefinite programs (SDP), generalize a previous SDP relaxation of the OPF problem. This paper presents an approach for improving the computational performance of the moment relaxations for many problems. This approach enforces second-order cone programming (SOCP) constraints that establish necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for satisfaction of the SDP constraints arising from the higher-order moment relaxations. The resulting "mixed SDP/SOCP" formulation implements the first-order relaxation using SDP constraints and the higher-order relaxations using SOCP constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that this mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation is capable of solving many problems for which the first-order moment relaxation fails to yield a global solution. For several examples, the mixed SDP/SOCP relaxation improves computational speed by factors from 1.13 to 18.7.

				<span id="iscas2015_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Recently, there has been significant interest in convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite relaxation globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for which the semidefinite relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the success or failure of the semidefinite relaxation are valuable for determining whether the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical conjecture is that failure of the semidefinite relaxation can be related to  physical characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The semidefinite relaxation fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success (or otherwise) of the semidefinite relaxation must involve factors beyond just the network physics.

					Power system planning and operation offers multitudinous opportunities for optimization methods. In practice, these problems are generally large-scale, non-linear, subject to uncertainties, and combine both continuous and discrete variables. In the recent years, a number of complementary theoretical advances in addressing such problems have been obtained in the field of applied mathematics. The paper introduces a selection of these advances in the fields of non-convex optimization, in mixed-integer programming, and in optimization under uncertainty. The practical relevance of these developments for power systems planning and operation are discussed, and the opportunities for combining them, together with high-performance computing and big data  infrastructures, as well as novel machine learning and randomized algorithms, are highlighted.

					Recently, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations has been applied to the optimal power flow problem. When this relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero duality gap), a globally optimal solution is obtained. Existing literature investigates sufficient conditions whose satisfaction guarantees zero duality gap solutions. However, there is limited study of non-zero duality gap solutions. By illustrating the feasible spaces for optimal power flow problems and their semidefinite relaxations, this paper investigates examples of nonzero duality gap solutions. Results for large system models suggest that non-convexities associated with small subsections of the network are responsible for non-zero duality gap solutions.

					The application of semidefinite programming (SDP) to power system problems has recently attracted substantial research interest. Specifically, a recent SDP formulation offers a convex relaxation to the well-known, typically nonconvex "optimal power flow" (OPF) problem. This new formulation was demonstrated to yield zero duality gap for several standard power systems test cases, thereby ensuring a globally optimal OPF solution in each. The first goal of the work here is to investigate this SDP algorithm for the OPF, and show by example that it can fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., it has a nonzero duality gap) in some scenarios of practical interest. The remainder of this paper investigates a SDP approach utilizing modified objective and constraints to compute all solutions of the nonlinear power flow equations. Several variants are described. Results suggest SDP's promise as an efficient algorithm for identifying large numbers of solutions to the power flow equations.

					The Electricity Modernization Act of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the creation of enforceable reliability standards for users, owners, and operators of the “Bulk-Power System” (BPS). This paper introduces an algorithm based on electrical properties of an electric power network that yields a numeric ranking of its branch elements, as a step towards identifying which elements should be considered part of the BPS. This ranking depends solely on network topology and element electrical characteristics, and is wholly independent of generator cost functions and system operating point. Two perspectives for deriving and justifying this ranking algorithm are described: one based on the sensitivity of bus-to-branch Lagrange multipliers and another based on generation shift factors. Summary results obtained from applying the algorithm to a detailed model of the US Eastern Interconnection are reported (with suitable anonymity for any facility specific data, in keeping with Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) protections).

					Motivated by the potential for improvements in electric power system economics and reliability, this dissertation investigates applications of a semidefinite programming relaxation of the power flow equations, which model the steady-state relationship between power injections and voltages in a power system. In contrast to other optimal power flow solution techniques, semidefinite program solvers can reliably find a global optimum in polynomial time when the semidefinite relaxation is "tight" (i.e., the solution has zero relaxation gap). Semidefinite relaxations have been applied to a variety of computationally difficult problems in many fields. The power systems literature details limited success in applying semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which minimizes operating cost under engineering and network constraints. Semidefinite programming holds significant promise for application to other power systems problems.</br></br>

					This dissertation first investigates power system economics using a semidefinite relaxation of the OPF problem. In contrast to claims in the literature, this dissertation shows that the semidefinite relaxation may fail to give a physically meaningful solution (i.e., the solution has non-zero relaxation gap) for some practical problems. This dissertation also provides computational and modeling advances required for solving large-scale, realistic OPF problems. Modeling advances include allowing multiple generators at the same bus; parallel transmission lines and transformers; and an approximate method for modeling constant impedance, constant current, constant power (ZIP) loads. Existing methods exploit system sparsity to speed computation using matrix completion techniques that decompose the large positive semidefinite matrix constraint into constraints on many smaller matrices. Computational advances include modifying the matrix decomposition techniques for further reductions in solver times, extending the applicability of an existing decomposition, and a method for obtaining an optimal voltage profile from a solution to a decomposed semidefinite program. This dissertation also provides a sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution obtained by any method.</br></br>

					This dissertation next provides techniques for improving power system reliability. The first reliability-related research develops a sufficient condition under which the power flow equations have no solution. This sufficient condition is evaluated using a feasible semidefinite optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solvability boundary. This distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins. A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); this dissertation additionally introduces a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages. This dissertation considers generators modeled as ideal voltage sources and generators with reactive power limits, which require either mixed-integer semidefinite programming or sum of squares programming formulations.</br></br>

					Also related to power system reliability is the problem of finding multiple solutions to the power flow equations. Power systems typically operate at a high-voltage, stable power flow solution; however, other solutions are used for stability calculations. Existing literature claims that a continuation-based algorithm can reliably find all power flow solutions. This claim is demonstrated to be incorrect with a small counterexample system. Thus, no computationally tractable algorithms exist for reliably finding all power flow solutions. Methods for calculating multiple power flow solutions therefore deserve further research. This dissertation describes a method for finding multiple power flow solutions using semidefinite programming. Results suggest the method's promise for identifying large numbers of power flow solutions.</br></br>

					Although the semidefinite relaxation of the power flow equations is often "tight," non-zero relaxation gap solutions can occur. This dissertation investigates examples of non-zero relaxation gap solutions to semidefinite formulations for the optimal power flow problem, for the power flow insolvability condition, and for determining multiple solutions to the power flow equations.

				<span id="msthesis2010_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					Eigenvalue problems incorporate multiplicative nonlinearities in otherwise linear equations. Two power systems problems with multiplicative nonlinearities are reformulated as eigenvalue problems. Reformulation allows for the application of eigenvalue theory and solution techniques to these problems.</br></br>

					The first problem involves determination of the initial conditions for induction machine internal variables in a non-linear dynamic power system analysis. The internal variables of stator and rotor currents, rotor speed, and mechanical torque must be determined from the given values of input real power, stator voltage magnitude, and stator voltage angle. This problem is posed in an eigenvalue formulation that can be solved using standard linear algebra techniques. The eigenvalue formulation allows for determination of all possible solutions for the internal variables rather than the single solution obtained from traditional iterative methods. Additionally, the absence of non-zero real eigenvalues indicates that the problem has no solution. Both single-cage and double-cage induction machine models are considered, and numeric examples are presented.</br></br>

					The second problem involves reformulation of the power flow equations as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem. In this formulation, both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are composed of the d and q orthogonal components of the bus voltages. The two parameter formulation of the power flow equations for two bus systems can be solved directly by decomposing the problem into two generalized eigenvalue problems that must be simultaneously satisfied. Since n bus systems require 2(n-1) parameter eigenvalue problems, which do not yet have a general solution method for n > 2, systems with more than two buses are not yet directly solvable from the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation.</br></br>

					In addition to direct solution, two other research avenues for the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations are pursued. First, motivated by eigenvalue problem structure, a reformulation of the multiparameter eigenvalue form of the power flow equations is presented. Although it is without known practical applications, this reformulation and the intermediate results in its derivation are interesting from a theoretical standpoint. Second, an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is performed on the multiparameter eigenvalue formulation of the power flow equations. The linearization obtained from the eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is equivalent to the linearization obtained from the power flow Jacobian.</br></br>

					Future developments in multiparameter eigenvalue theory may provide additional insights into solutions of the power flow equations. General solution techniques for multiparameter eigenvalue problems with more than two parameters may enable direct solution of the power flow equations. A method for determining the number of solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful as a stopping condition for continuation power flows. Conditions for the existence of any solutions to multiparameter eigenvalue problems would be useful for finding the point of voltage collapse and for analyzing power systems in heavily loaded conditions.

				<span id="pglibopf2019_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					In recent years, the power systems research community has seen an explosion of novel methods for formulating the AC power flow equations. Consequently, benchmarking studies using the seminal AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem have emerged as the primary method for evaluating these emerging methods. However, it is often difficult to directly compare these studies due to subtle differences in the AC-OPF problem formulation as well as the network, generation, and loading data that are used for evaluation. To help address these challenges, this IEEE PES Task Force report proposes a standardized AC-OPF mathematical formulation and the PGLib-OPF networks for benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms. A motivating study demonstrates some limitations of the established network datasets in the context of benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms and a validation study demonstrates the efficacy of using the PGLib-OPF networks for this purpose. In the interest of scientific discourse and future additions, the PGLib-OPF benchmark library is open-access and all the of network data is provided under a creative commons license.

				<span id="fourbus_nsol2016_type" class="abstract" style="display:none">
					The power flow equations model the steady-state relationship between the power injections and voltage phasors in an electric power system. By separating the real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors, the power flow equations can be formulated as a system of quadratic polynomials. Only the real solutions to these polynomial equations are physically meaningful. This paper focuses on the maximum number of real solutions to the power flow equations. The literature provides upper bounds on the number of real power flow solutions based on the maximum number of complex solutions. There exist two- and three-bus systems which have as many real solutions as the upper bounds given by the maximum number of complex solutions. It is an open question whether this is also the case for larger systems. This paper uses a conjecture and recent algorithmic developments from Galois group theory to suggest a negative answer to this question. Specifically, this paper studies a generic four-bus system composed of PV buses. If a conjecture in Galois group theory holds, the maximum number of real power flow solutions for this system is upper bounded by 16, which is strictly less than 20, the maximum number of complex solutions. This paper also provides parameter values for this system which give rise to 16 real solutions, so this upper bound is achievable.

					The Electric Power Grid is a critical infrastructure upon which the nation relies for delivery of much of its energy use.  It supports the needs of industry, commerce, and consumer end use. Reliability and economic efficiency are essentials.  Disruptions are inconvenient and can be very costly. The research presented here is directed towards optimal use of grid resources to ensure reliability and minimize cost. The analysis and optimization needs for planning and operation of the electric power system are challenging to meet due to the scale and form of model representations. The connected network spans the continent and the mathematical models are inherently nonlinear. Traditionally, computational limits have necessitated the use of very simplified models for grid analysis, and this has resulted in either less secure operation, or less efficient operation, or both. The research conducted in this project advances techniques for power system optimization problems that will enhance reliable and efficient operation. The results of this work appear in numerous publications and address different application problems include Optimal Power Flow (OPF) [8, 9, 15, 52, 53], unit commitment [41], demand response [46, 49], reliability margins [32, 33, 38], planning [42, 47, 48], transmission expansion [50, 51], and general tools and algorithms [43, 44, 45]. Importantly, the research has been successfully transferred into the practical application domain by its inclusion in the most recent release of the widely-used MATPOWER suite of power system analysis tools.
